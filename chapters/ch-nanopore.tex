\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:np-intro}

%
A central objective in nano\-science is to control transport phenomena
at nanometer scale to explore new technological opportunities.  The
reduction of characteristic dimensions of nano\-materials gives rise
to substantially different transport properties in comparison to their
bulk counterparts \cite{Schoch_2008_nanofluid}.
%
One well-known example is the nanopore, in which the effect of
surface-mediated transport becomes dominant when the pore size is
comparable to the characteristic length of diffusion, enabling new
applications such as ionic diodes
\cite{Karnik_2007_nanofluidic,Siwy_2002_fabrication_NPore,Vlassiouk_2007_nanofluidic},
field-effect transistors \cite{Nam_2009_IFET_sub10nm}, desalination
\cite{Heiranian_2015_desali}, and nanopore-based DNA sequencing
\cite{Heerema_2016_gr_np_DNA,Garaj_2013_hugging_gr_pore}.
%
In this sense, atomically thin 2D material are not only promising due
to their unique electronic properties, but also as the thinnest
membrane materials allowing ultimate permeation when combining with
nanopores
~\cite{Suk_2010_water_PG,Jiang_2009_PG_gas,Celebi_2014_science,Koenig_2012,Drahushuk_2012_gas_permeation_gr}.
%
Early research has shown the potential of desalination using graphene
with sub-nanometer pores, which hinders ion passage without losing
water permeability
\cite{Cohen_Tanugi_2012,Suk_2014_ion_sub_5nm,Cohen_Tanugi_2014_permeab,Cohen_Tanugi_2015_PG,O_Hern_2014_ion,O_Hern_2015_ion_gr,Surwade_2015_desali_npg,Walker_2017_cation_select_2D,Ghosh_2018_PG_ion}.
Nevertheless, there are still several technical issues to be solved.
In practice, the fabrication of sub\-nanometer pores in
a 2D material sheet with atomic precision and over a large area with
atomic precision, still remains challenging.
\cite{Suk_2014_ion_sub_5nm,Rollings_2016_gating,O_Hern_2012_defect,Wang_2017_mechanism_thin_membrane}.
%
Moreover, a small portion of excessively large pores or defects can
significantly deteriorate the membrane performance.
%
% Regarding these
% issues, we have previously developed a highly-scalable technique to
% fabricate uniformly-distributed nanopores (sub-20 to 50 nm) over
% wafer-scale graphene samples \cite{Choi_2018_wafer_scale_gr}.
A major step towards the real-world desalination and separation
applications of nanoporous 2D material membranes, would be to develop
methodology that allow appreciable selectivity while the pore size can
be even larger than the hydration radii.
% Therefore, it is critical to develop methodology that
% allow appreciable selectivity of nanoporous 2D membrane even with
% large pore size.

Inspired by the ion channels in cellular
membranes~\cite{Chung_2007_biological_ion_chan}, the selectivity of
nanopores can not only be controlled by size-exclusion, but also by
engineering the surface charge and potential.
%
A number of recent reports have explored the effect of surface charges
on the selectivity of ion transport through graphene nanopores, as a
consequence of the electrostatic interactions between solvated ions
and the charged functional groups attached on graphene, indicating
that ion selectivity can exists in pores with diameter even as large
as 30 nm~\cite{Rollings_2016_gating,Surwade_2014_carbon_electrochemical_ion}.
%
However, it remains controversial if the surface charges can result in
a degree of salt rejection, as the surface charge / potential in these systems
cannot be precisely quantified, which are sensitive to the surroundings
as well as the history of chemical treatment
\cite{Li_2008_gr_suspension}.
%
A fundamental understanding of the interactions between the charged 2D
nanopores and the electrolyte solution, especially the mechanism of
ion transport through these nanopores, is still absent.

In this chapter, combining experimental and theoretical studies, we
investigate electrolyte permeation through centimeter scale,
electrostatically gated nanoporous graphene membranes, with pores that
are in the order of $\sim{}$\unit[20]{nm}.
%
We find that electrostatic gating can effectively reduce ion transport
through these membranes, despite the pore size is significantly larger
than the hydration radii of the ions. We model the surface potential
around the graphene nanopores, by taking into account the elementary
electronic properties of graphene (\eg the quantum capacitance).
%
The interplay between graphene quantum capacitance and the electrical
double layer is found to selectively modulate the anionic and cationic
transport paths, creating voltage-dependent electrochemical barriers
when the pore size is comparable to the Debye screening length. Our findings
reveal a new degree of freedom regulating electrolyte permeation
through porous two-dimensional materials, complementary to the pore
size design and engineering.

\section{Results and discussions}
\label{sec:np-np-res}

\subsection{Experimental Observations}
\label{sec:np-np-exper-observ}

The experimental realization of electrostatically-gated nanoporous
graphene membranes are carried out in the group of Prof. Hyung Gyu
Park in ETH Zürich.

  \label{fig:np-scheme}
\end{figure}

%
 \autoref{fig:np-scheme}a depicts the experimental setup characterizing
ionic diffusion through a sheet of double layer porous graphene
(PG).
%
Two reservoirs, namely the high-concentration reservoir (HCR)
containing electrolyte solution with molar concentration $c_0$, and
the low-concentration reservoir (LCR) containing de-ionized (DI)
water, are separated by a PG membrane supported by a polycarbonate
track-etched (PCTE) film.
%
Magnetic stirrers are used to minimize the effects of external
concentration polarization in both reservoirs.
%
A conductivity
probe is placed in the LCR to monitor the ionic concentration as a
function of time. The membrane is attached to a piece of copper tape
connected to a voltage source applying an electrical bias
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$, with the LCR grounded ( \autoref{fig:np-scheme}a
inset).
%
The structure of the PCTE-supported PG membrane is schematically shown
in \autoref{fig:np-scheme}b. The PG membrane were fabricated using the
block-copolymer (BCP) patterning technique developed in
\cite{Choi_2018_wafer_scale_gr}, which enables formation of
uniformly-distributed nanopores over large area up to 25 cm$^{2}$
(details see \autoref{sec:np-methods}).
%
The pores perforated on graphene have average pore diameters of
20$\pm$10 nm and a high pore density of 1.25$\pm$0.25$\times$10$^{10}$
cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to an average inter\-pore distance of
$90\pm10$ nm  (\autoref{fig:np-scheme}c inset).
%
By optimizing the subsequent transfer
process~\cite{Choi_2018_wafer_scale_gr}, a high surface coverage
($>$98\%) of PG on PCTE was obtained (\autoref{fig:np-scheme}c).
The high quality of the membrane allows
reliable characterization of the ion transport behavior.
%


The experimental setup presented
here allows us to systematically investigate the diffusive flux of
ions across a sheet of PG ($\symbf{J}$), driven by the gradient of
electrochemical potential in the electrolyte medium.
%
First, the control experiments were carried out by measuring the ionic
diffusion ($\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{PCTE}}$) of seven salt species,
including KCl, NaCl, LiCl, K$_{2}$SO$_{4}$, MgSO$_{4}$, CaCl$_{2}$ and
K$_{3}$[Fe(CN)$_{6}$], through the bare PCTE membrane at $c_{0}$ = 0.1
mM.
%
As the diffusive flux is comparably small, the measured conductivity
in the LCR increases almost linearly with time (e.g.
\autoref{fig:np-rejection}a) within the measurement duration (1 h), suggesting
the diffusive flux, and thus the concentration gradient across the
membrane remain constant without gating.
%

    $s_{3}$). \textbf{b}. Molar diffusive flux through bare PCTE (blue

    different salts. \textbf{c}. Circuit analog model for the
    transport resistance through PG-PCTE membrane. \textbf{d}. Ratio

    gating, $f_{\mathrm{PCTE/PG0}}$ from both experiment and the
    circuit analog model}
  \label{fig:np-rejection}
\end{figure}

Next, we carried out the same experiments using the PG-covered PCTE
membrane (PG-PCTE), without electrostatic gating. The measured
diffusive flux values, $\symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PG0}}$, remain at the same
order of magnitude compared with $\symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PCT}}$
(~\autoref{fig:np-rejection}b).
%
Such results suggest that the transport resistance of PCTE membrane
$R_{\mathrm{PCTE}}$ is dominant over that of PG without gating,
$R_{\mathrm{G}}^{0}$.
%
Using a simple circuit analog model (~\autoref{fig:np-rejection}c),
the overall transport resistance through the PG-PCTE membrane without
gating, is controlled by the resistance of both membranes
($R_{\mathrm{PCTE}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{G}}^{0}$). The resistance
$R_{\mathrm{G}}^{0}$ is estimated by $\gamma^{-1} R_{\mathrm{g}}^{0}$
where $\gamma$ is the average pore density per PCTE channel and
$R_{\mathrm{g}}^{0}$ is the average resistance through individual graphene
pores without gating.
%
Since the transport
resistances of PCTE and PG membranes are in series, the ratio between
can be estimated from experimental measurements:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:np-resist-ratio}
  f_{\mathrm{PCTE/PG0}} = \frac{R_{\mathrm{PCTE}}}{R_{\mathrm{G}}^{0}}
  = \left(\frac{\symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PCTE}}}{\symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PG0}}} -1 \right)^{-1}
\end{equation}%
%
which gives $\delta$ in the range of $1\sim{}5$
depending on the type of salt.
%
On the other hand, the transport resistances in both PCTE and PG films without gating can be estimated using geometric parameters in the circuit analog model.
%
For a long PCTE channel with length $L$ and $r_{\mathrm{PCTE}}$,
$R_{\mathrm{PCTE}}$ has power law of $L/r_{\mathrm{PCTE}}^{2}$ from
Fick's law of diffusion, while for a graphene pore with radius
$r_{\mathrm{G}}$ and vanishing thickness, the resistance of individual
pore $R_{\mathrm{g}}^{0}$ has power law $1/r_{\mathrm{G}}$
\cite{O_Hern_2014_ion}:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:np-R-both}
  R_{\mathrm{PCTE}} &= &k_{\mathrm{PCTE}} \frac{L}{r_{\mathrm{PCTE}}^{2}} \\
  R_{\mathrm{g}}^{0} &= &k_{\mathrm{g}} \frac{1}{r_{\mathrm{G}}}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $k_{\mathrm{PCTE}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{g}}$ are the coefficient
associated with PCTE and PG membranes, respectively. The value of
$\delta$ is then expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:np-delta-resistance}
  \delta
  = \frac{R_{\mathrm{PCTE}}}{R_{\mathrm{G}}^{0}}
  = {\displaystyle
    \frac{k_{\mathrm{PCTE}}}{k_{\mathrm{g}}}
    \frac{L r_{\mathrm{G}} \gamma}
        {r_{\mathrm{PCTE}}^{2}}}
\end{equation}
Here we take $L$=24 $\mu$m, $r_{\mathrm{G}}$=10 nm,
$r_{\mathrm{PCTE}}$=200 nm. From simple Fick's law, the coefficient
$k_{\mathrm{PCTE}}$ is determined as $1/(D_{\mathrm{\pm}} \pi)$. On
the other hand $k_{\mathrm{G}}$ is taken as $3 \pi / D_{\mathrm{\pm}}$
using the analog of the Sampson formula for
fluid\cite{Roscoe_1949_sampson_formula}. As a result the theoretical
value of $\delta$ has lower bound of $\sim$2.2, close to the values
extracted from experimental data as shown in \autoref{fig:np-rejection}d.

  
We next study the effect of electrostatic gating on nanoporous graphene. 
In order to consider the background diffusion when no gate voltage is
applied, we apply the ``three-interval'' method, which has been used in
controlling the membrane potential in mesoporous carbon membranes
\cite{Surwade_2014_carbon_electrochemical_ion}.
%
\autoref{fig:np-rejection}a illustratively represents how the measured
conductivity evolves with time, with the conditions summarized as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First interval ($s_{1}$): $V_{\mathrm{G}} = 0$, conductivity probe on.
  
\item Second interval ($s_{2}$): $V_{\mathrm{G}} \neq 0$, conductivity probe off.

  \item First interval ($s_{3}$): $V_{\mathrm{G}} = 0$, conductivity probe on.
\end{enumerate}
Specifically, in the first interval,
the gate voltage source is turned off and the conductivity probe is
on, allowing us to obtain the conductivity-time profile with an
average slope $s_{1}$ that corresponds to the diffusive flux across
the PG-PCTE membrane. In the second interval, a voltage
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ is applied to the PG membrane after turning off the
conductivity probe, followed by the third interval $s_{3}$, in which
the conductivity probe is turned on again to give the corresponding
slope. A control experiment was performed to ensure the copper tape
was not in direct contact with the ionic solution.
%
The slope corresponding to the
second interval $s_{2}$, as the conductivity probe is off, is
determined by linear interpolation of the conductivities from the
endpoint of interval 1 to the starting point of interval 3. A decrease
of $s_{2}$ indicates that the total flux through
PG-PCTE is reduced upon gating (\ie salt penetration through the PG
pores is hindered).
%
We define such experimentally measured reduction rate as $\chi$ (not
to be confused with the electron affinity $\chi_{\mathrm{S}}$ in
\autoref{ch:qc}), which is equivalent to the decrease of total
diffusive flux through PG-PCTE as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:np-rejection}
  \chi = \frac{\bar{s} - s_{2}}{\bar{s}} = \frac{\symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PG0}}
    - \symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PG}}(V_{\mathrm{G}})}{\symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PG0}}}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{s}$ is the average slope of $s_{1}$ and $s_{3}$, namely
$(s_{1} + s_{3})/2$, and
$\symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PG}}(V_{\mathrm{G}})$ is the diffusive flux
across the PTCE-supported PG double layer as a function of
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$. Since graphene and PCTE membranes effectively form a
transport system with series diffusive resistance $R_{\mathrm{G}}$
(tunable by $V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and $R_{\mathrm{PCTE}}$ (independent of
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$), respectively, we define the effective degree of
salt rejection from bare PG, $\xi$, as a function of $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:np-xi-def}
\xi = 1 - \frac{R_{\mathrm{G}}(V_{\mathrm{G}}=0)}{R_{\mathrm{G}}(V_{\mathrm{G}})} = \frac{(\delta+1) \chi}{\delta \chi + 1}
\end{equation}
The factor $\xi$ (not to be confused with the Matsubara frequency
$\xi_{n}$ in \autoref{ch:vdw}) is a reliable and stable measure of
salt rejection through the PG membrane itself upon gating, as the salt
species and initial conditions may induce a degree of measurement
uncertainty between different samples. Note the $\xi=1$ limit
represents perfect salt rejection when
$R_{\mathrm{G}}(V_{\mathrm{G}}) \to \infty$. On the contrary $\xi=0$
indicates $R_{\mathrm{G}}$ remains unchanged with $V_{\mathrm{G}}$.

     $V_{\mathrm{G}}>0$. %

  \label{fig:np-conductivity-rej} 
\end{figure}

Using 0.1 mM KCl solution in HCR, we obtained $\xi$ as a function of
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ within $\pm1.25$ V, before triggering the
electrochemical reactions (\autoref{fig:np-conductivity-rej}a). We observe an
asymmetric dependence of $\xi$ with respect to $V_{\mathrm{G}}$, with
a higher degree of salt rejection for $V_{\mathrm{G}}>0$, when
positive carriers (holes) are induced in graphene.
%
We notice that an
increase of $\xi$, or a decrease of diffusive flux through PG with
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$, shows an inverse trend compared with those
observed in ionic field effect transistors, in which the
diffusive flux instead increases with the gate voltage
\cite{Nam_2009_IFET_sub10nm,Cheng_2018_gate_gox}. A further increase of the KCl
concentration $c_{0}$ influences the obtainable degree of salt
rejection.
%
We note the small negative $\xi$ values (corresponding to reduced transport resistance) at $V_{\mathrm{G}} \sim{}$ -0.5 V also exist, which are
likely caused by (i) offset of the charge neutral point (CNP) of graphene from $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 0, and (ii) experimental uncertainty.
Nevetherless, significant salt rejection is observed when $V_{\mathrm{G}}>$ 0.5 V.
%
The maximum $\xi$ values measured at $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 1.25 V,
$\xi_{\mathrm{max}}$, as a function of $c_{0}$ from 10$^{-4}$ to
10$^{-2}$ M KCl  exhibit
a power law dependency (\autoref{fig:np-conductivity-rej}b).
The
$\xi_{\mathrm{max}}-c_{0}$ relation can be nicely fitted by a power
law function following
$\xi_{\mathrm{max}} c_{0}^{0.52} = \mathrm{Constant}$. As the Debye
length in solution, $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$, is inversely proportional
to $c^{0.5}$, we infer that the $V_{\mathrm{G}}$-induced salt
rejection originates from the modulation of the electrical double
layer (EDL), as will be discussed later.


\subsection{Self-Consistent Ion Transport Theory}
\label{sec:np-theory}

In order to quantitatively understand the observed $V_{\mathrm{G}}$
dependence, a theoretical framework is proposed to simulate the
coupling of graphene's elementary transport properties and EDL, in
order to quantify the ionic transport through a graphene
nanopore. Under the assumption that the time scale for concentration
change in the bulk liquid is significantly longer than
that of ionic diffusion, the pseudo-steady state approximation to use constant concentrations in both LCR and HCR, is valid.
%
Accordingly, the steady-state Nernst-Planck equation describing
the ionic transport in an electrolyte solution is given by
\cite{MacGillivray_1968_NPE}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:np-pnp}
  \nabla \cdot \symbf{J}_{i} = -\nabla \cdot (\frac{D_{i}}{k_{\mathrm{B}}T} c_{i} N_{\mathrm{A}} \nabla \mu_{i}) = 0
\end{equation}
where $\symbf{J}$ is the mass flux, index \textit{i} corresponds to
the ionic species (anion or cation), $D$ is the ion
diffusivity, $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is
temperature, $c$ is the molar concentration, $N_{\mathrm{A}}$ is the
Avogadro constant, and $\mu$ is the electrochemical potential. Under
the assumption of ideal solution, the electrochemical potential
follows \cite{Kilic_2007_steric_effect_ion}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:np-mu}
  \nabla \mu_{i} = k_{\mathrm{B}} T \nabla \ln x_{i} + z_{i} e \nabla \psi
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the molar fraction in solution, $z$ is the ionic valence,
$e$ is the unit charge, and $\psi$ is the electric potential.
%
The potential profile in the system is described by the Poisson
equation by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:np-poisson}
  \nabla \cdot (\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}} \varepsilon_{0} \nabla \psi)
  =
  - N_{\mathrm{A}} e \sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}$ is the relative permittivity of
individual materials in the system, including water and the internal
Stern layer (see \autoref{sec:org492fdee}), and $\varepsilon_{0}$ is
the vacuum permittivity.
%
Note although the carrier concentration may not essentially follow the
Poisson-Boltzmann distribution, due to the huge concentration
different between the two reservoirs~\parencite*{Zheng_2011_PNPB}.
%
The graphene layer is electrostatically charged when
applying $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ to graphene adjacent to the electrolyte
solution; the electroneutrality of the entire system suggests:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:np-electro-neutral}
  \sigma_{\mathrm{G}} S_{\mathrm{G}} + \sum_{i} \int_{\Omega} z_{i} c_{i} N_{\mathrm{A}} e \mathrm{d}^{3} \Omega= 0
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\mathrm{G}}$ is the charge density in graphene,
$S_{\mathrm{G}}$ is the total area of graphene, and $\Omega$
corresponds to the entire volumetric domain of electrolyte
solution. Note that the graphene surface potential,
$\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$, is not equivalent to $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ due to graphene's quantum capacitance (see \autoref{ch:qc}):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:np-Vg}
  V_{\mathrm{G}} = \Delta \phi_{\mathrm{G}} + \psi_{\mathrm{G}}
\end{equation}
where
$\Delta \phi_{\mathrm{G}} = \phi_{\mathrm{G}}(V_{\mathrm{g}}) -
\phi_{\mathrm{G}}(V_{\mathrm{g}}=0)$ is the change of graphene’s work
function.
%
The properties of the PG samples fabricated here is close to
intrinsic graphene, with charge density at $V_{\mathrm{G}}=0$ measured
to be 1.4$\times$10$^{11}$ \textit{e}$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ using a field-effect graphene transistor, corresponding
to a work function difference of 48 meV from graphene's CNP
, which is much smaller than the $\Delta \phi_{\mathrm{G}}$
induced by gating.
%
Therefore we adopt the simplification that the
CNP of graphene coincides the Fermi level at
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 0.
%
From \autoref{sec:qc-mean-field-model}, the elementary electronic
properties of graphene give
\( {\displaystyle \Delta \phi_{\mathrm{G}} =
  \mathrm{sign}(\sigma_{\mathrm{G}}) \frac{\hbar v_{\mathrm{F}}}{e}
  \sqrt{\frac{\pi |\sigma_{\mathrm{G}}|}{e}}}\), where $\hbar$ is the
reduced Planck constant, and $v_{\mathrm{F}}=1.1\times10^{6}$
m$\cdot$s$^{-1}$ is the Fermi velocity of graphene.
%
Note that the PG film fabricated experimentally is double-layer
turbostratic (randomly aligned) graphene, in which we assume the
influence of interlayer coupling is minimal, and the
$\Delta \phi_{\mathrm{G}} - \sigma_{\mathrm{G}}$ follows that in
monolayer graphene.
%
The influence of polymer residue on the surface of graphene is not
considered in the current theory framework due to: (i) insulating
polymer residues do not respond to the gate voltage (see
\autoref{sec:org492fdee}) and (ii) the thickness of the polymer
residue is minimal after the thermal annealing
process~\cite{Choi_2018_wafer_scale_gr}.
%
The theory proposed here was solved self-consistently by discretizing
\autoref{eq:np-pnp}-\autoref{eq:np-poisson} using the finite-element
method (FEM), in which the graphene surface potential is coupled with
\autoref{eq:np-electro-neutral} and the electronic structure of
graphene that were solved simultaneously to reach convergent numerical
solutions of $\sigma_{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ for a given
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$. Clearly, the above model yields symmetric
characteristics for $\sigma_{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ with
respect to $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ due to the symmetric band structure of
graphene (\autoref{eq:np-delta-phiG}).
%
However, for graphene
synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) used in the ion transport
experiments, it is well-recognized that the electron traps are
inherently introduced during synthesis and patterning
\cite{Dean_2010_BN_gr_highquality}, effectively reducing the charge
density and surface potential on graphene when $V_{\mathrm{G}}<0$.
%
We ascribe the existence of interfacial traps to the
that observed asymmetry of $\xi$ in  $V_{\mathrm{G}}<0$ regime
in \autoref{fig:np-conductivity-rej}a.
%
%
Therefore,the discussions in the rest of this chapter focuses on the
regime of $V_{\mathrm{G}}>0$. The concept of the interplay between graphene's quantum capacitance and the EDL is schematically shown in \autoref{fig:np-3}a.

\end{figure}
We would like to point out, although the ion transport phenomena occur
at near-continuum scale through the 20-nm-wide pores, the fundamental
electronic properties of graphene still have strong influence.
%
For
example, \autoref{fig:np-3}b presents the calculated
$\sigma_{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ as a function of
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ considering the ionic diffusion through a single 20
nm-diameter nanopore drilled on a sheet of semi-infinite double layer
graphene that separates HCR containing KCl solution at $c_{0}$ = 0.1
mM, and LCR at $c_{0}/10$ in axisymmetric coordinates (details see \autoref{sec:np-methods}). Indeed, the
interplay between graphene quantum capacitance and the EDL
significantly reduces the graphene surface potential
$\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\sim$0.3 V at $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 1.25 V,
corresponding a surface charge density $\sigma_{\mathrm{G}}$ of
$\sim$0.08 C$\cdot$m$^{-2}$.
As we mentioned in the introduction, an
important merit of the gated 2D nanopore system considered here,
is the precise control over the
surface charge density and potential,
rather than being treated as a fitting parameter as in most of the 2D
nanopore literature (e.g. \cite{Rollings_2016_gating}).
%
In addition, we anticipate that the gate-controlled ionic transport
can also be achieved by replacing graphene with other nanoporous
conducting 2D materials, although the operational gate voltage window
required to achieve the same degree of salt rejection may be narrower,
because graphene has the smallest quantum capacitance (near the Dirac
point) among all known 2D materials (see
\autoref{sec:qc-gener-behav-2deg}).

\subsection{Mechanism of Salt Rejection}
\label{sec:np-mechanism}

The numerical procedure described above allows us to resolve the
concentration and electric potential profiles near a graphene
nanopore for a given $V_{\mathrm{G}}$.
%
Since the ionic flux is driven
by both $\psi$ and $c$ fields (see  \autoref{eq:np-pnp} and \autoref{eq:np-mu}),
we focus on the electrochemical potential $\mu_{i}$, which represents
the combined driving force, to reveal its dependence on the applied
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$.
%
Using the same system considered in 
\autoref{fig:np-3}b, the calculated axisymmetric electrochemical potentials,
$\Delta \mu_{+}$ and $\Delta \mu_{-}$, for
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 0.75 V are shown in  \autoref{fig:np-2D-plots}a and
\autoref{fig:np-2D-plots}b, respectively. %
The reference point of the electrochemical
potentials is set at the bulk phase in the HCR in both cases.
%

  and anion mass transfer flux perpendicular to the pore (\textbf{c}
  and \textbf{d}, respectively) are shown with $V_{\mathrm{G}} = 0.75$
  V.  The reference of electrochemical potential is set in the HCR far
  from the graphene layer. The diffusive pathways for both ions are
  indicated by the arrows in \textbf{c} and \textbf{d}, respectively}
  \label{fig:np-2D-plots}
\end{figure}
%
% As expected, the electric potential reaches the maximum at the
% graphene surface (with $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ of $\sim$100 mV) and decays
% towards the bulk solution phase, forming an EDL surrounding the
% graphene surface. Since the Debye length $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ is
% comparable to the pore radius $r_{\mathrm{G}}$, the electric potential
% in the center of the nanopore remains at $\sim$25 mV, comparable to
% the thermal energy at room temperature ($k_{\mathrm{B}}T$ = 26
% meV). Consequently, it is evident that the potential barrier is
% sufficient to modulate the diffusive flux.
By increasing $V_{\mathrm{G}}$, a more positive $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ on
graphene surface reduces the cation concentration at the pore edge due
to the electrostatic interactions, thereby increasing its
concentration gradient at the pore center. On the other hand, the
anion concentration near the pore edge increases exponentially, such
that the concentration gradient at the pore center becomes small
%
Although the surface
concentration of anions is enhanced by $\sim{}$30 times, it is sill
much smaller than the saturated surface adsorption density, and the use of
bulk diffusivity in the Nernst-Planck equation (~\autoref{eq:pnp}) still holds.
%
%
The observations confirm the distinct ionic transport pathways upon
applying a positive $V_{\mathrm{G}}$: pore center for cations and pore
edge for anions, is further confirmed by the mass transport flux
$\symbf{J}_{z}$ perpendicular to the pore as shown in
\autoref{fig:np-2D-plots}c and \autoref{fig:np-2D-plots}d, respectively.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

       considered. \textbf{c}. Calculated average z-components of
       cation, anion, and total fluxes through the graphene nanopore
       as functions of $V_{\mathrm{G}}$, showing salt rejection for
       all fluxes.}
  \label{fig:np-4}
\end{figure}
%
\autoref{fig:np-4}a and \autoref{fig:np-4}b further show the calculated $\symbf{J}_{z}$ value
at $z=0$ (inside pore),as a function of the normalized radius, $r/r_{\mathrm{G}}$ ,
where $r$ is the radial coordinate and $r_{\mathrm{G}}$ is the pore
radius, at different $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ values. Note a negative
$\symbf{J}_{z}$ means flux from HCR ($z>0$)to LCR ($z<0$) in the
simulation box (details see \autoref{sec:np-methods}).
%
At $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 0 (pure
diffusion), the anion and cation flux profiles are identical, with a
higher flux near the pore edge.
This is expected, as the
concentration gradient is higher.
%
By gradually increasing
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$, both ion fluxes are reduced throughout the pore, while
the degree of reduction is more pronounced at the pore edge for the
cation, and at the pore center for the anion, following the scenarios
we discussed above. Accordingly, the average flux across the
pore, $|\symbf{J}_{z}|$, are reduced with $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ (
\autoref{fig:np-4}c). A total flux reduction of $\sim$90\% is
predicted. Another interesting finding here is that, by increasing
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$, the nanopore transport preferentially allows cations
over anions, or in other words, the anion flux is more reduced with
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ (see \autoref{fig:np-4}c), similar to the ion
selectivity of graphene nanopore observed in other studies~\cite{Rollings_2016_gating}.
%
In our
setup, the imbalance between cation and anion fluxes near the graphene
nanopore is compensated by the EDL formation at the counter-electrode
in LCR, which maintains the electroneutrality of the system. Notably,
since atomically thin graphene samples are used, the mechanism of salt
rejection is clearly distinct from that in capacitive deionization
\cite{Biesheuvel_2010_desalin_theory}, where electrodes with large
surface area are required.


The above findings, nevertheless, do not fully clarify the
experimentally observed reduction of diffusive flux upon
gating. Indeed, the same physical mechanism also governs the {
  diode-like ionic transport through an ionic field effect transistor
  \cite{Nam_2009_IFET_sub10nm,Lee_2015_sub10nm,Feng_2016_porous_MoS2} or a nanoporous metal membrane
  \cite{Mccurry_2017_electrolyte_porus_gold}}, in which a nonzero electric
potential at the nanopore center usually results in an increase of
ionic conductivity. We confirm this by further increasing the graphene
surface potential $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ considering the same system, and intriguingly, $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ larger than 400 mV, the ionic flux
starts to increase, reversing the trend observed at the low
$\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ regime, due to (i) the drift flux become dominant
over diffusion flux and (ii) the concentration near the pore edge
(preferred path) greatly increases.
%g
Nevertheless, this level of $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ cannot be
reached experimentally in graphene membrane, as this requires a
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ larger than 2.0 V, which would trigger the electrochemical
reactions \cite{Toh_2011_GO_electrochem}.
%
On the other hand, in an ionic field effect transistor, the electric
potential on the pore wall is considerably higher, equivalent to
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ due to the metallic nature of gate electrode (having
an infinitely-large quantum capacitance). We therefore conclude that
the quantum capacitance-induced nonlinear damping in the surface
potential results in the observed salt rejection.  Following the above
discussions, we further investigate the physical limits for the biased
graphene nanopores. Specifically, the salt rejection characteristics
are controlled by: (i) the overlap of EDL inside the nanopore,
essentially controlled by two length scales of $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$
and $r_{\mathrm{G}}$, and (ii) the graphene surface potential
$\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ controlled by $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ following
 \autoref{eq:np-Vg}. To this end, we calculate $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ as a
function of $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}} / r_{\mathrm{G}}$ and
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$, as shown in  \autoref{fig:np-5}a).
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  \caption{The influence of Debye length effect on the degree of salt
      rejection. \textbf{a}. Calculated contour plot of the surface
    potential of graphene $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ as a function of
    $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}/r_{\mathrm{G}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{G}}$. When
    the Debye length reduces, a higher $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ is required to
    maintain the same surface $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$
    level. \textbf{b}. Calculated 2D contour plot of theoretically
    predicted $\xi$ as a function of
    $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}/r_{\mathrm{G}}$ and

    be achieved by having a higher $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ and
    $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}/r_{\mathrm{G}}$}
  \label{fig:np-5}
\end{figure}
%
Clearly, when the bulk concentration $c_{0}$ increases, a higher
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ is required to reach the same level of
$\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$. Consequently, as revealed in the contour plot of
\autoref{fig:np-5}b, the calculated salt rejection factor $\xi$
increases with both $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}} / r_{\mathrm{G}}$ and
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$, in line with the experimentally observed
$\xi - c_{0}$ dependence. We also find the overall trends for
$\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\xi$ with respect to
$\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}/r_{\mathrm{G}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ are very
similar. More importantly, based on our theoretical prediction, with
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 1.25 V and $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}} / r_{\mathrm{G}}$
= { 2.0}, a high value of $\xi$ up to $\sim$0.95 can be achieved.  We
notice that although the above analysis suggests a salt rejection up
to 1 may be achived by further reducing the pore size (i.e. increasing
the $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}/r_{\mathrm{G}}$ ratio), our theory, derived
from on the macroscopic transport equations by treating ions as
zero-volume charges, may not be valid when $r_{\mathrm{G}}<$ 5
nm\cite{Jain_2015_subcontin_ion}.  Advanced theoretical frameworks
that bridge continuum and molecular models are required to elucidate
the role of surface adsorption in electrolyte transport through
approaching the small pore limit.



We notice that the calculations in \autoref{fig:np-4} and
\autoref{fig:np-5} are based on the setup of ionic transport through
single nanopore.  In order to mimic the experimental conditions,
calculations were carried out by considering the pore size
distribution in  \autoref{fig:np-scheme}c inset.  Under the
criteria that the inter\-pore distance ($\sim{}90$ nm, see
\autoref{sec:np-np-res}) is significantly larger than the Debye length
($\sim{}30$ nm), we assume that the ionic transport pathways through
different nanopores do not influence each other and the total ionic
flux $\symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PG}}$ is the summation of fluxes through
individual pores $\symbf{J}_{i}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:np-J-total}
\symbf{J}_{\mathrm{PG}} = \sum_{i} \symbf{J}_{i} = \sum_{r_{i}} x_{r_{i}} \symbf{J}_{r_{i}}
\end{equation}
where $r_{i}$ is the radius of individual pores,
$\symbf{J}_{r_{i}}$ and $x_{r_{i}}$ are the flux of individual
pore and the distribution probability when
$r_{\mathrm{G}} = r_{i}$.
%
Combining with \autoref{eq:np-xi-def}, the overall salt rejection
$\xi$ is estimated by the linear combination of the salt rejection
$\xi_{r_i}$ from individual pores with radius $r_i$ given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:np-rejection-comb}
\xi = \sum_{r_{i}} \xi_{r_{i}} w_{r_{i}}
\end{equation}
where
$w_{r_{i}} = x_{r_{i}} r_{i}^{2} / \sum_{r_{i}} x_{r_{i}} r_{i}^{2} $
is the contribution factor from pores with radius $r_{i}$, and
$x_{r_{i}}$ is the fraction of pores with radius $r_{i}$.
%
To get an insight of the influence of the pore size distribution on
the salt rejection, \autoref{eq:np-rejection-comb} is combined with 
the pore distribution taken from the SEM image of real samples.
%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  \scalebox{1.05}{\import{\imgdir}{pore_dist.pdf_tex}}
   \caption{Salt rejection after considering the pore size

  \label{fig:np-simple-rect-pore}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:simple-rect-pore}a shows the contribution $w$ and $\xi$ as
a function of $r_{\mathrm{G}}$ for individual pores when
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 1.25 V. As can be seen, the majority of pores fall
within the regime of $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}} / r_{\mathrm{G}} > 1$,
corresponding to $\xi(r_{\mathrm{G}}) > 0.6$. As a result, considering
the influence of pore distribution reduces the value of $\xi$ to $\sim{}$80\% to
that of a single 20 nm-diameter nanopore (
\autoref{fig:simple-rect-pore}b), which is indeed close to the highest
$\xi$ values that experimentally observed.
%
Consider the existence of large pores with diameter up to 60 nm, the
appreciable salt rejection even after considering the pore size
distribution, can be explained by the non-linear nature of $\xi$ with
$r_{\mathrm{G}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{G}}$. As seen in \autoref{fig:np-5}b,
in large $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}} / r_{\mathrm{G}}$
regime, $\xi$ reaches a ``plateau'' with its value close to 1.
%
From our
analysis, it is also clear reducing the average pore size is critical
to overcome the low salt rejection at higher concentrations, which may
hopefully be achieved with more advanced fabrication techniques.


\subsection{Effects of Salt Species}
\label{sec:np-salts}

Finally, we examine other salt species and compare the degree of salt
rejection between experiments and simulations.
%

  \label{fig:np-6}
\end{figure}


\autoref{fig:np-6}a
presents the measured salt rejection $\xi$ as a function of
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ at $c_{0}$ = 0.1 mM, for the seven salt species
considered here, including NaCl, LiCl, KCl, MgSO$_{4}$, CaCl$_{2}$,
K$_{2}$SO$_{4}$, and K$_{3}$[Fe(CN)$_{6}$].
%
%
Similar to the KCl system discussed in \autoref{sec:np-theory}, the
salt rejection is more pronounced in the positive $V_{\mathrm{G}}$
regime.
%
The degree of salt rejection deceases with the salt valance; for
example, the measured $\xi$ values at $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 1.25 V
decreases from $>$0.5 for mono\-valent NaCl to -0.04 for multi\-valent
K$_{3}$[Fe(CN)$_{6}$].
%
This observation is endorsed by our simulations, in which we calculate
$\xi$ as a function of $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ using the same simulation
setups (\autoref{fig:np-6}b).
%
As discussed above, the effect of pore
size distribution is explicitly considered in the FEM simulation
results with different pore sizes.
%
The calculated
$\xi_{\mathrm{max}}$ values are quantitatively compared with
experimental results with the same trend observed (\autoref{fig:np-6}c).
%
Indeed, because the Debye length $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ decreases with
the salt valence, the graphene surface potential appears to decrease
in the multivalent salt systems, thereby reducing $\xi$ (see
\autoref{fig:np-5}b).
The slightly higher $\xi$ values of LiCl and NaCl compared with KCl
observed in the experiments, are also supported by the FEM simulation
results in \autoref{fig:np-6}b, which we attribute to the lower
diffusivities of Li$^{+}$ and Na$^{+}$
ions~\cite{vanysek_2000_CRC_diffusivity}.
%
The calculated and
experimental $\xi_{\mathrm{max}}$ as a function of
$\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ are consequently plotted for the seven salt
species considered here (\autoref{fig:np-6}d).  
  % Similar to the experimental observations, slightly higher $\xi$ for
  % salts with same valence (e.g. LiCl, NaCl and KCl) is also observed
  % in the simulations due to the variation in ionic mobilities as well
  % as the possible specific surface adsorption of ions.
We notice that
without any fitting parameters, our theory predicts the
experimental values reasonably well.
%
In addition, the $\xi_{\mathrm{max}}-\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ dependency
is approximately linear, suggesting that the effect of
$\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ is dominant over the salt diffusivity.
%
This
finding also explains the concentration dependence of
$\xi_{\mathrm{max}}$ observed in \autoref{fig:np-conductivity-rej}b, as
$\lambda_{\mathrm{D}} \propto c_{0}^{-0.5}$.
%
% It
is % worth noting that the observed linearity can only describe the % $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ range considered here. When % $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ increases beyond 30 nm, this linear relation % would yield a $\xi_{\mathrm{max}}$ value larger than 1, which % appears to be unphysical.  More follow-up experimental and % theoretical efforts are required to further investigate the % small/large $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ regimes. Also note that the salt % diffusivity (see (4)) and the specific surface adsorption of ions % may also influence the experimentally observed $\xi_{\mathrm{max}}$ % beyond the simple $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ effect.}
Further including
the specific interaction of ionic species with the graphene membrane
-- such as cation-$\pi$ interaction~\cite{Shi_2013_ion_enrichment} --
may give even better agreement with experimental results
\cite{Ghosh_2018_PG_ion}.
%
More interestingly, based on our theoretical
analysis, we predict that a very high degree of salt rejection ($\xi>$
0.99) can be already achieved when $\lambda / r_{\mathrm{G}}>$3.
%
In
other words, for example, when the Debye length is 20 nm, one can
suppress 99 \% of the diffusive flux by further reducing the pore
radius down to 5--6 nm, which still remains larger than the
hydrated radii.
%
In combination with the development of nanoscale
etching techniques, we believe that the physical picture presented
here makes one step closer to large-scale production of graphene
membranes.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:np-conclusions}

In this chapter, we carry out a comparative experimental and modelling
study on macroscopic salt rejection through a sheet of large-area
porous graphene under electrostatic gating.
%
From both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, we show
the modulation of ionic species through electrostatically gated
graphene nanopores is achievable, even if the average pore size significantly exceeds the hydration radii of ions.
%
Using self-consistent transport model combined with the fundamental
electronic properties of graphene, we show that the small quantum
capacitance of atomically-thin graphene, leads to a considerably
decrease of surface potential compared with the applied gate
voltage.
%
As a result, the subtle redistribution of the electrochemical
potential creates new ion-specific pathways, which in turn
leads to a considerable degree of salt rejection.
%
We report a high
degree of salt rejection at $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ = 1.25 V by approximately
one order of magnitude, based on our experiments and theoretical
predictions.
%
The observed salt rejection positively correlates with the Debye
length that nonlinearly modulates the graphene surface potential and
charge density.
%
The fundamental principles presented here open an
avenue towards realization of atomically thin 2D porous membranes for
controlled ion permeation, allowing to tailor the ion transport
through porous 2D materials.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:np-methods}

\subsection*{Experiment}
\label{sec:np-met-experiment}

The experimental part are performed in the lab of Prof. Hyung Gyu Park
in ETH Zürich. The minimal descriptions of the methods are given as
follows.


\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\paragraph{Graphene patterning and transfer to PCTE}: Spherical block
copolymer (s-BCP) based patterning has enabled the manufacturing of
perforated graphene membranes having pores in the range of 10 nm to 50
nm on average up to wafer-scale\cite{Choi_2018_wafer_scale_gr}. In
brief, s-BCP (polystyrene-block-polymethylmethacrylate, PS-b-PMMA,
195-b-20, Polymer Source Inc, Canada, 1 weight\% in anhydrous toluene)
is spin-coated from solution and thermally annealed at 220 $^{\circ}$C
for 6 h in vacuum. Microphase separation of s-BCP leads to distinct
phases: the minor phase will form spheres (PMMA) and the major phase
will form the matrix (PS). Oxygen plasma (8 , 100 W, 25 mTorr, Oxford
Instruments plc) removes the top layer PS from the PMMA spheres, which
are subsequently etched in glacial acetic acid to form a porous etch
mask directly on top of the double layer graphene. Anisotropic etching
using oxygen beam milling (10 s, 100 mA, 600 V acceleration voltage,
Oxford IonFab 600) leads to perforation of the underlying graphene
through the porous PS mask. Polymer residues are removed by thermal
annealing in hydrogen:argon (9:1) at 400 $^{\circ}$C. The patterned
graphene is transferred to PCTE membranes (hydrophobic, 400 nm pores,
from Sterlitech) by baking the PCTE briefly to the perforated graphene
at 180 $^{\circ}$C followed by a lift-off etch in buffered
hydrofluoric acid (BHF) as described
by\cite{Choi_2018_wafer_scale_gr}.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\paragraph{Membrane preparation} The ion-diffusion and gating experiments are
performed in a custom-made diffusion cell. An initial dip-wetting
procedure using ethanol/water 1:1 is performed to wet the membrane,
followed by extensive washing and inserting the membrane. The
diffusion cell is filled immediately after mounting the membrane with
DI water to prevent drying. The ion solution is placed on the HCR
side, distilled water on the LCR side, with a volume of 7.33 mL for
each cell. Bar-stirrers close to the membrane ensure well-mixed
solutions avoiding potential external concentration polarization
effects. Water channels in the fixture ensure stable measurement
temperatures using a chiller. The temperature for all measurements is
kept at 25 $^{\circ}$C. A conductivity probe (eDAQ, Pty Ltd.,
Australia), inserted on the LCR side measures the conductivity, which
is recorded with time steps of 2 s. The membrane is kept wet for the
entire series of experiments, multiple rinsing steps with DI water are
performed after each experiment and change to a different salt
solution. The salt solutions were prepared immediately before the
experiments using MilliQ water that was additionally distilled to
increase purity level. The distilled water, has a conductivity of
0.0012 mS/cm with a pH of 6.3, no buffer has been used in these
experiments. 7 salts were used: KCl, NaCl, LiCl, K$_{2}$SO$_{4}$,
CaCl$_{2}$, MgSO$_{4}$ and K$_{3}$[Fe(CN)$_{6}$]. The salts were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification,
salt solutions were prepared by subsequent dilution of a base solution
(1 M) to the final concentrations.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\paragraph{Ion diffusion experiments} { Baseline measurements were
performed using a single bare PCTE (b-PCTE) with defined membrane area} by extracting the diffusion rates
of 3 measurements and averaging the resulting values. For the measurement, DI water was filled on
the LCR side, where a 0.1 mM salt solution is placed on the HCR side
of the fixture. The conductivity increase was recorded over 1 h before
rinsing and replacing both sides with fresh solutions.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\paragraph{Ion gating experiments}
{ The salt fluxes through ungated and gated graphene
was characterized using a single patterned graphene on PCTE (PG-PCTE)} 
in a 3-interval-type measurement based on salt diffusion: 1h per interval
with (i) no bias (ii) bias and (iii) no bias, ruling out possible
electrochemical effects at the membrane that might mislead
interpretation of the conductivity reading. The voltage is applied via
copper tape so that the membrane acts as a working electrode (WE). A
platinum wire (length 3 cm, diameter 0.6 mm) placed in the low
concentration side of the diffusion cell with a distance of $\sim$3.5 cm
from the PG-PCTE membrane is counter- (CE) and reference electrode
(RE) simultaneously, forming effectively a two-electrode setup. An
electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT204, Metrohm Autolab S.V.) is used
to apply the selected voltage.
{ In a control experiment, the conductivity of water was monitored when applying a bias of \unit[1.25]{V} and \unit[-1.25]{V} to the graphene membrane. A conductivity increase of \unit[0.015]{$\mu$S$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$} was observed for the duration of one hour, suggesting that the effect of gating on pH is negligible.

  For each salt, we have measured the rejection by alternating from
  negative (starting at -\unit[1.25]{V}) to positive bias, decreasing
  to \unit[0]{V} in \unit[0.25]{V} steps. The order of measuring the
  salts was KCl, LiCl, MgSO$_4$, NaCl, K$_3$(Fe(CN)$_6$), CaCl$_2$ and
  K$_2$SO$_4$.}

\subsection*{Numerical Simulations}
\label{sec:np-numer-simul}

Numerical simulations using finite element method (FEM) were carried
out using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a. A single pore in graphene is
simulated, with the horizontal length of the simulation box set to 20
times of the nanopore size (see \autoref{fig:nanopore-simu-box}).
%

  \caption{\label{fig:nanopore-simu-box} Scheme of the simulation box
    and boundary conditions used in the numerical simulations,}
\end{figure}

The potential at the
bottom of the LCR and the center of the graphene domains are set to be
0 and $\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$, respectively. The potential at the end of
HCR is not set explicitly, but rather determined through the Poisson
equation with no flux boundary condition
$\boldsymbol{D}^{\mathrm{norm}}=0$. The relative permittivity in the
HCR and LCR is set as $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{}}=78$. The relative
permittivity of the Stern layer is set to
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{H}}=20$\cite{Conway_1951} and for the graphene
domain we set the relative permittivity as a large number
(e.g. $10^{5}$) for a better convergence of the solver.  For the
transport of diluted ionic species, we use the PNP equations, to
describe the diffusion and drift of the ions, which can be further
unified by the gradient of electrochemical potential, as described in
the main text. The initial values of the electrolyte is set to $c_{0}$
in HCR and 0.1 $c_{0}$ in LCR. At the ends of the cells in the
z-direction, we use the inlet boundaries conditions for the
concentration of electrolytes, that the concentration on these
boundaries remains the same with the initial value, due to the
effective mixing in the experimental setup.

The
transport of ionic species was solved by the Nernst-Planck equation,
with the electrostatic potential further given by the Poisson
equation. Since the surface on graphene cannot be predetermined, we
performed all calculations by setting the values of
$\psi_{\mathrm{G}}$. The surface charge of graphene is further
extracted and used to reconstruct the value of actual $V_{\mathrm{G}}$
applied to graphene.  { Under the experimental pH conditions, the salt
  concentration is at least 2 orders of magnitudes larger than the
  protons and hydroxides, and therefore the pH effects in our
  numerical simulations were not explicitly considered.  } We examined
the convergence of the solutions by performing simulations with varied
mesh sizes.
