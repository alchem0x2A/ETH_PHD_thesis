\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:asym-introduction}


Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) composed of two-dimensional
(2D) crystals and precisely assembled opens a new avenue for promising
electronic and optoelectronic applications with promising
characteristics~\cite{Geim_2013_2D_vdw_Het,Jariwala_2016_mixed_vdw_het,Novoselov_2016_vdW,Liu_2016_rev,Withers_2015_LED_vde_Het,Britnell_2012_FET}.
%
With the properties of individual 2D material layers well studies
since the discovery of graphene and other 2D
materials~\nocite{Novoselov_2005_2D_crystal},
%
the challenge is how achieve unprecedented physical and chemical
phenomena different from the isolated 2D sheets via controlled
combination of different layer~\cite{Geim_2013_2D_vdw_Het}.
%
The continuous development of experimental methods which allows
fabrication of 2D vdWHs with atomistic precision via bottom-up
approaches~\cite{Jariwala_2016_mixed_vdw_het,Novoselov_2016_vdW,Liu_2016_rev},
is benefited from the
atomic flatness and absence of dangling bonds at the surface of 2D
layered materials, as discussed in \autoref{sec:inter-forc-at}.
%
A large variety of 2D vdWHs are fabricated using building
blocks graphene, hBN and
TMDCs~\cite{Dean_2010_BN_gr_highquality,Xue_2011_STM,Withers_2015_LED_vde_Het,Britnell_2012_FET,Cui_2015_multiterm_mos2}.
%
It is important to remark that a large majority of these studies
employs the electrostatic field effect (see
\autoref{sec:qc-introduction}) to modulate the charge states in the
vdWHs to achieve tunable carrier
transport~\cite{Britnell_2012_FET,Dean_2013_butterfly} as well
carrier-photon
interaction~\cite{Britnell_2013_vdWE,Withers_2015_LED_vde_Het}.
%
%
The relative simple setup of electrostatic gating enables insight into the charge transfer, and on the
electric field screening through the 2D vdWHs.
%
The penetration of electrostatic field through a 2D vdWH is similar to the idea of field effect transparency through mono\-layer 2D material introduced in
\autoref{ch:qc}, while with a more complex manner.

In this chapter, we introduce a self-consistent multilayer quantum
capacitor model (MQCM) to simulate the penetration of field effect
through vdWHs. By taking fundamental electronic properties (\eg
bandgap, DOS and Fermi level) of isolated layers, MQCM is capable of
solving the charge density and potential distribution in a certain 2D
vdWH.
%
Using the MQCM, we further extend the concept of electrostatic field
effect transparency to vdWHs, and quantifies the penetration depth of
an external field in multilayer graphene stacks.
%
More interestingly, taking graphene/2H-MoS\textsubscript{2} interfaces
as an example, our model predicts that the field effect in side a 2D
vdWH may be asymmetric due to the varied DOS and mismatch of
Fermi level between individual layers.
%

Our predictions are backed up by experimental examination and first
principles simulations from our collaborators.
%
Using electric force microscopy (EFM), the
graphene/MoS\textsubscript{2} heterostructures exhibit distinct
electric response to external fields which depends on the stacking
sequence.
%
A large depolarization field is recorded at the
MoS\textsubscript{2} side, which is shown to be dependent majority
on the number of MoS\textsubscript{2} layers into the
heterostructure.
%
At the atomistic level, quantum mechanical \textit{ab initio}
simulations based on vdW-corrected density functional theory (DFT) are
employed to resolve the electronic properties of the vdWHs, including
polarization, charge transfer and band structures,
%
which indicate that
the anisotropic formation of interfacial dipole moments preferable at
the MoS\textsubscript{2} facet accounts for the asymmetric
response.
%
The simplicity of the model developed here allows exploration of
further 2D material combination with appreciable computational speed,
which may greatly benefit the design of 2D vdWH-based functional
devices.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:asym-results}


\subsection{Self-Consistent Multilayer Quantum Capacitor Model (MQCM)}
\label{sec:asym-model}

The ideal of the self-consistent multilayer quantum capacitor model
(MQCM) is to treat individual 2D material as discrete quantum
capacitors with vanishing thickness, such that the charge--potential
relation can be described by the quantum capacitance $C_{\mathrm{Q}}$.
%
Note here only limit the discussion to randomly-stacked 2D layers,
that the interlayer coupling~\cite{Fang_2014_intercoupl_vdW} effect is
ignored.

\subsubsection{Field-Effect Transparency of Multilayer Graphene}
\label{sec:asym-field-pene-ml-gr}

To demonstrate the idea of MQCM, we first consider the situation of an
electric displacement field in the multilayer metal-oxide-graphene-semiconductor
quantum capacitor (ML-MOGS QC).
%
The setup resemble the monolayer MOGS QC in \autoref{fig:qc-Scheme},
with monolayer graphene replaced by a $N$-layer graphene stack.
SiO\textsubscript{2} and Si are chosen as the oxide and semiconductor
layers, respectively.
%
The structure of ML-MOGS QC is schematically illustrated in
\autoref{fig:asym-scheme_ML_MOGS}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  % \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{img/SI_ML_graphene.eps}
  \caption{Schematic for the multilayer graphene MOGS QC system}
  \label{fig:asym-scheme_ML_MOGS}
\end{figure}
%

We assume that each graphene layer is separated by a distance $d_0$
($\sim{}$3.3 \AA{}\cite{Shearer_2016}) with interlayer permittivity
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{G}} \approx 2.4$ taken from the value of
graphite~\cite{Lui_2011_tunable,Regan_2012_ScreeningEngineered_PV}.
%
The index of layer, $i$,  starts from the first graphene sheet adjacent to
the oxide surface
%
For simplicity, we neglect the space between the first ($i=1$)
graphene layer and the oxide layer, as well as the interface states
(see \autoref{sec:qc-field-effect-transp}) between the last ($i=N$)
graphene layer and the semiconductor layer.
%
The electric fields in
the oxide layer and  at the semiconductor surface
are $\E_{\mathrm{ox}}$ and $\E_{\mathrm{S}}$, respectively.
%
We label the electric field between
the $i$ and $i+1$ graphene layers as $\E_{\mathrm{G}, i}$.
%
The charge density of layer $i$ is labeled as $\sigma_{\mathrm{G}, i}$

Applying the Gauss's law on the $i$-th graphene
with sheet charge density, we get a set of conservation equations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $i=1$\\
    \begin{equation*}
      \label{eq:asym-gauss-1}
      \E_{\mathrm{ox}}\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ox}} + \sigma_{\mathrm{G},1} - \E_{\mathrm{G}, 1}\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{\mathrm{G}} = 0
    \end{equation*} 
  \item $i=2 \cdots N-1$\\
    \begin{equation*}
      \label{eq:asym-gauss-2}
      \E_{\mathrm{G}, i-1}\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{\mathrm{G}} + \sigma_{\mathrm{G},i} - \E_{\mathrm{G},i+1}\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{\mathrm{G}} = 0
    \end{equation*}  
  \item $i=N$\\
    \begin{equation*}
      \E_{\mathrm{G},N-1}\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{\mathrm{G}} + \sigma_{\mathrm{G},N} - \E_{\mathrm{S}}\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{\mathrm{S}} = 0
    \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}                 %
where $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ox}}=2.8$\worktodo{check} and  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{S}}=11$ are the permittivities of the oxide and semiconductor layers, respectively.
%
Note that the difference between the vacuum energy level
$\Delta E_{\mathrm{vac}}(i, i+1)$ between $i$ and $i+1$ graphene layers
($i=1\cdots N-1$) is identical to the difference between work
functions of the two layers ($\phi_{\mathrm{G}, i}$ and $\phi_{\mathrm{G}, i+1}$):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:asym-diff-E}
  \Delta E_{\mathrm{vac}}(i, i+1) = \E_{\mathrm{G}, i}d_0 = \phi_{\mathrm{G},i+1} - \phi_{\mathrm{G},i}
\end{equation}
%
The above series of equations uniquely define the electrostatics in
the ML-MOGS QC, and can therefore be solved numerically in a
self-consistent manner by giving an initial guess of $\E_{\mathrm{S}}$.

\worktodo{2 figures here}

To see the effect of the MQCM, we calculate the induced charge density
of the semiconductor layer $\sigma_{\mathrm{S}}$ as a function of
total graphene layer number $N$, an the charge on the metal gate
$\sigma_{\mathrm{M}}$, as shown in \worktodo{figure which}a.
%
To see a higher degree of field penetration to the semiconductor
layer, we choose the intrinsic carrier density $n_{0}$ to be $10^{18}$
cm$^{-3}$ (\ie a higher $C_{\mathrm{S}}$).
%
We observe that $\sigma_{\mathrm{S}}$ becomes independent of
$\sigma_{\mathrm{M}}$ when more than 10 layers of graphene are used in
the ML-MOGS QC.
%
This is as expected: intuitively speaking, the total DOS of multilayer
graphene increases with the layer number and results in a larger
$C_{\mathrm{Q}}$ value.
%
In the case of graphite ($N \to \infty$), the electric displacement
field is completed screened and $\sigma_{\mathrm{S}}$ becomes independent
of $\sigma_{\mathrm{M}}$.
%
Note in the MQCM, the field effect transparency arises as a collective
effect of the charge density regulation between layers. This avoids
cumbersome derivation the total DOS of multilayer graphene by the
tight-bonding model \cite{Nilsson_2008_bitri_gr_electron} or
\textit{ab initio} calculations, while provide appreciable insights
and flexibility.
%
We further extend the concept of field-effect transparency
$\eta^{\mathrm{FE}}$ to ML-MOGS QC system, with the same definition
$\eta^{\mathrm{FE}}(N) = -\left(\dfrac{\partial
    \sigma_{\mathrm{S}}}{\partial \sigma_{\mathrm{M}}}\right)$ while
dependent on the total layer number $N$.
%
\worktodo{figure} shows $\eta^{\mathrm{FE}}$ as function of both $N$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{M}}$.
%
Similar to the observation in \worktodo{figure}a, the effective
penetration length of field effect appears as $\sim{}$10 layers, while
field-effect transparency shows an asymmetric response to different
polarity of the gate electrode.
%

The MQCM approach proposed here is excellently scalable with respect
to the layer number to be used for questions such as electrode doping
of graphene
layers~\cite{Pi_2009_metal_doping_gr,Giovannetti_2008_doping}.
%
As an demonstration, we calculate the work function profiles in the
perpendicular direction of a 100-layer MOGS QC, as shown in
\worktodo{figure xx}.
%
Two boundary layers appear both the oxide/grapehene and
semiconductor\allowbreak{}/graphene interfaces, analogous to the
electrical double layer in electrolyte
solutions~\cite{Bard_1980_electrochem_book}.
%
At the center of multilayer sheet ($i \sim{} 50$), the work function
of graphene is almost identical to the CNP, indicating the electric
field is fully screened inside the multilayer graphene.
%
Considering the small interlayer permittivity, such nano\-scale
electrostatic screening is caused by the charge transfer between the
individual graphene layers.
%
Taking the concept of Debye screening length (see
\autoref{eq:intro-debye}), we estimate the
effective sheet charge density $\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}$ of the graphene layers to be:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:asym-debye}
\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}} = \dfrac{\varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{\mathrm{G}} k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{e^{2} \lambda_{\mathrm{FE}}^{2}} d_{0}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{\mathrm{FE}}$ is the penetration length of field
effect ($\sim{}10\cdot{}d_{0}$). At $T=300$ K, $\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}$
is estimated to $\sim{}9\times10^{9}$ e$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$, which is
close to the value of intrinsic thermal carrier density of graphene
reported~\cite{Fang_2007_carrier_graphene}.

\subsubsection{Electrostatic Screening in Graphene/MoS\textsubscript{2} vdWHs}
\label{sec:asym-classic}

The approach presented in \autoref{sec:asym-field-pene-ml-gr} can also be applied to 2D vdWHs composed of distinct 2D material layers.
%
As an example we study the case of graphene (G) /
2H-MoS\textsubscript{2} heterostructures with varied layer numbers
corresponding to the experimental results from our collaborator (will
be shown later).
%
For simplicity, we refer the 2H-MoS\textsubscript{2} as
MoS\textsubscript{2} throughout this chapter.
%

\worktodo{Figure} 6(a) schematically shows the band diagram of the
G/MoS\textsubscript{2} vdWH used in our model.
%
Here we consider an isolated vdWH placed under an external electric $\E_{\mathrm{ext}}$,
and does not have carrier transfer with the exterior (similar to the
experimental conditions in the electric force microscopy
(EFM)~\cite{Li_2014_screen}).
%
Similar to the naming convention in \worktodo{figure ??}, the layer
index $i$ starts from the outer-most graphene layer.
%
When the system is at equilibrium, we assume that the Fermi level
$E_{\mathrm{F}}$ aligns throughout the G/MoS\textsubscript{2}
vdWH.
%
For simplicity of the model, we further assume that; (i) the intrinsic
electronic properties of individual layers, including density of
states (DOS), band gap $E_{\mathrm{g}}$, and work function $\phi$ are
invariable with the stacking order and the external electric field and
(ii) the interlayer distance ($d_{\mathrm{i, i+1}}$) between layers
$i$ and $i+1$ is not affected by the external electric field.
%
Note although the layer-dependent transition of band
structure~\cite{Bhimanapati_2015_2D_rev} is ignored in assumption (i),
it has been shown that such classical treatment using Coulombic
coupling has high consistency with full-scale  \textit{ab initio}
simulations~\cite{Andersen_2015_dielec_vdWH}.
%
The charge and potential
distribution in a $N$-layer vdWH is solved by several conservation equations
in a self-consistent approach similar to that in \autoref{sec:asym-field-pene-ml-gr}, including:
%

\begin{enumerate}
\item The charge neutrality of vdWH \\
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:asym-neutral-vdwh}
    \sum_{i=1}^{\mathrm{N}} \sigma_{i} = 0
  \end{equation}
  where $\sigma_{\mathrm{i}}$ is the sheet charge density of layer $i$.

  
\item Charge balance of the $i$-th layer by Gauss's law \\
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:asym-gauss-vdwh}
    \E_{i-1, i}\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{i-1, i} + \sigma_{i} -  \E_{i, i+1} \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{i, i+1} = 0
  \end{equation}
  where $\E_{i-1, i}$ and $\varepsilon_{i-1, i}$ are the electric field and permittivity between layers $i - 1$ and $i$, respectively.
  %
  Note $\E_{0, 1}$ and $\E_{N, N+1}$ are essentially the external electric field $\E_{\mathrm{ext}}$.
  %
  The permittivity $\varepsilon_{i-1, i}$ is treated as the average bulk permittivities of layers $i-1$ and $i$

  
\item The charge--work function relation
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:asym-charge-wf}
    \sigma_{i}(\phi_{i}) = {\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}} \mathrm{DOS}(E')
    \left[f(E', -e\phi_{i}) - f(E', -e\phi_{i0})\right] \mathrm{d}E'
  \end{equation}
  where $\phi_{i}$ is the work function (under external field) and and
  $\phi_{i0}$ is the intrinsic work function (in isolated form) of
  layer $i$, respectively. $f$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution
  function.

  
\item The potential drop between layers $i$ and $i+1$
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:5}
    \Delta E_{\mathrm{vac}}(i, i+1) = e \phi_{i+1} - e \phi_{i} = \E_{i, i+1} d_{i, i+1}
  \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\worktodo{describe the parameters used here}

The set of equations
(\autoref{eq:asym-neutral-vdwh}--\autoref{eq:asym-charge-wf}) allows
describing the vdWH in a unified manner regardless of the actual
material involved, as long as the previous assumptions hold.
%
By solving the conservation
equations of electric field and charge density of the
G/MoS\textsubscript{2} vdWH, we can extract information about
interfacial and screening properties.
%
For the
simplest case of monolayer(1L) G/ 1L MoS\textsubscript{2}, 
\worktodo{Figure} 6(b) shows the work functions of both materials as a
result of $\E_{\mathrm{ext}}$ ranging from
-8 to +8 V/nm.
%
When highly n-doped and p-doped
MoS\textsubscript{2} can be found when $\E_{\mathrm{ext}}<-2.3$ V/nm or $\E_{\mathrm{ext}}> 5.5$ V/nm, respectively.
%
The Fermi level of MoS\textsubscript{2} shifts close to its conduction
band (CB) or valence band (VB) in both case respectively, which is
accounted for the charge accumulation in the vdWH. Note that a
noticeable charge accumulation ($>10^{12}$ $e$/cm$^{-2}$) occurs even
when the Fermi level of MoS\textsubscript{2} is $\sim{}$0.1 eV away
from the band edges, when the Fermi level of graphene shifts
significantly from its CNP. The charge separation between the layers
polarizes the 2D vdWH.
%
On the other hand, when $\E_{\mathrm{ext}}$is between -2.3 V/nm
and 5.5 V/nm, the Fermi level of MoS\textsubscript{2} lies far away
from the band edges, the vdWH is merely not
polarized.
%
We find that the polarization of the G/MoS\textsubscript{2} vdWH is
more enhanced under negative external electric field.%
In other words, the 1L G/ 1L MoS\textsubscript{2} vdWH asymmetrically
screens the external electric field $\E_{\mathrm{ext}}$.
%

We ascribe such asymmetry to the difference between the electronic
structures of graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2}: MoS\textsubscript{2}
is considered as a n-type semiconductor with its intrinsic Fermi level
(-4.5 eV) closer to its CB (-4.0 eV) than its VB (-5.8
eV)~\cite{Ochedowski_2014_contami_mos2,Das_2012_high_perform,Lu_2014_midgap_mos2},
while graphene has symmetric linear band structure around its CNP
(-4.6 eV)~\cite{Das_Sarma_2011_electron_gr}.
%
Here all energy levels are
compared with the vacuum level which is set at 0 eV.
%
Due to the resemblance of Fermi level values between graphene and
MoS\textsubscript{2}, little charge transfer occurs under weak
electric field, and the degree of charge transfer is mainly determined
by the position of the Fermi level with respect to the CB or VB of
MoS\textsubscript{2}, when the Fermi level of MoS\textsubscript{2}
lies far from its band edges. %
%
Following the same procedure, we extend the discussions to multilayer
G/Mo\textsubscript{2} vdWHs. For a $m$-layer graphene / $n$-layer
MoS\textsubscript{2} vdWH ($m$L G/ $n$L MoS\textsubscript{2}), we
calculate the sheet dipole moment $\mu(m, n)$, defined
as
$\mu(m, n) = \sum_{i=1}^{m+n} \sigma_{i} (\sum_{i=0}^{i-1} d_{i, i+1})$, as shown in \worktodo{which figure}.
%
Clearly, the vdWH is more polarized under negative $\E_{\mathrm{ext}}$.
\worktodo{clarify the direvtion of E}
%
By increasing the number of layer numbers, the magnitude of
$\E_{\mathrm{ext}}$ required to induce significant polarization in the
vdWH also becomes smaller, as compared with the 1L G/ 1L MoS\textsubscript{2} system.
%
The effect is enhanced when more
MoS\textsubscript{2} layers are included, with the largest increment
noticed in 3L G/ 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}/3L system.
%
On the other hand, the number of graphene layers has minor
contributions to the asymmetric behavior effect.
%
The similar effect is also seen in the charge density profile.
%
\worktodo{figure xx} shows the total charge density
$\sigma_{\mathrm{G}}$ in the grapehene layers
($\sigma_{\mathrm{G}} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sigma_{i}$) for different
combinations of $m$ and $n$ of the G/MoS\textsubscript{2} interface.
%
Similarly, the charge transfer at the G/MoS\textsubscript{2} interface
is more pronounced at negative $\E_{\mathrm{ext}}$ regime, due to the
fact that MoS\textsubscript{2} is more easily to be
n-doped~\cite{Amani_2015_mos2_QY1}.
%
The charge redistribution is more pronounced with increased layer
numbers of graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2}, and the
MoS\textsubscript{2} layers contributes more to such effect than
graphene.
%
Note comparing \worktodo{figure aa} and \worktodo{figure aa}, for
thicker graphene layers (e.g. 3L G/$n$L MoS\textsubscript{2}), a
considerable amount of total dipole moment can still be observed under
weak electric field ($|\E_{\mathrm{ext}}<5|$ V/nm), when the charge
transfer between graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2} is negligible ($<10^{11}$ $e \cdot$cm$^{-2}$).
%
This indicates that the electric field is well screened by
multilayer graphene under such conditions due to its semi\-metallic nature.
%
The screening in the
MoS\textsubscript{2} becomes more important only when the Fermi level
reach the band edges, when the DOS increases drastically.
%
To verify such statement, we reconstructed the band diagram of 1L G/
3L MoS\textsubscript{2} system under electric fields of
$\E_{\mathrm{ext}}=-2$ V/nm (\worktodo{Figure} 6(e)) and
$\E_{\mathrm{ext}}=+2$ V/nm (\worktodo{Figure} 6(f)),
respectively.
%
Under -2 V/nm electric field, the Fermi level reaches
the CB of the outermost ($i=4$) MoS\textsubscript{2} layer, while under +2
V/nm electric field, the Fermi level remains within the band gap of
MoS\textsubscript{2} resulting in very small charge transfer,
% in good accordance with the ab initio calculations showed in
% \worktodo{Figure} 5(d)-5(f).
In other words, charge accumulation occurs mostly on graphene and the
outer-most MoS\textsubscript{2} layer, a similar effect as seen in \worktodo{figure in ML MOGS part}


\section{Experimental Observation of Asymmetric Screening in G/MoS\textsubscript{2} vdWHs}
\label{sec:asym-exp}
Heterostructures of graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2} of different thicknesses on Au
coated Si wafer were achieved by two rounds of PMMA
transfer~\cite{Minemawari_2011_inkjet_PMMA}. \worktodo{Figure} 1a shows the
optical image of 1-4L thick graphene nanosheets mechanically
exfoliated on a SiO\textsubscript{2} (90 nm)/Si substrate. Their thickness was
confirmed by the Raman spectra, as shown in \worktodo{Figure} 1b. The intensity
of the 2D band of the 1L graphene was much stronger than that of the G
band; while the intensity of the 2D and G bands of the 2L graphene is
comparable. The Raman results are consistent with previous
reports~\cite{Ferrari_2006_raman}.  The absence of Raman D band
suggests the high quality of the graphene. Atomically thin MoS\textsubscript{2}
nanosheets were exfoliated on a SiO\textsubscript{2} (270 nm)/Si substrate (\worktodo{Figure}
1c). The portions with different purplish optical contrast gave
$E_2g^1$ and $A_1g$ Raman bands centered at 385.3 and 404.7 cm$^{-1}$,
384.3 and 406.3 cm$^{-1}$, and 383.6 and 407.2 cm$^{-1}$, respectively (\worktodo{Figure}
1d). Therefore, they corresponded to 1-3L
MoS\textsubscript{2}~\cite{Lee_2010_anomal_raman_mos2,Chakraborty_2012_mos2_layer_raman}. The
AFM image of the MoS\textsubscript{2} sample can be found in Supporting Information,
\worktodo{Figure} S1. To fabricate MoS\textsubscript{2}/graphene heterostructures, the MoS\textsubscript{2} was
first transferred onto the graphene with the help of PMMA, and then
the MoS\textsubscript{2}/graphene structure was relocated onto a 100 nm-thick Au
coated SiO\textsubscript{2}/Si substrate, as shown by the optical microscopy photo in
\worktodo{Figure} 1(e). The corresponding AFM image of the heterostructure on Au
is displayed in \worktodo{Figure} 1(f).  We used EFM to measure the electric
field screening properties of the MoS\textsubscript{2}/graphene heterostructures. EFM
has been used to investigate the electric field screening in graphene,
BN, and MoS\textsubscript{2}
nanosheets~\cite{Datta_2009_ML_Screening,Castellanos_Gomez_2012_interlayer,Li_2014_screen}.
%
However, the experimental setup in the current study was slightly
different from those in these previous reports. We applied a DC
voltage sweeping from +9 to −9 V to the Au substrate, which generated
external electric fields of different intensities. The tip of the
conductive cantilever which was grounded but oscillating at its first
resonant frequency stayed at a few nanometers above the
heterostructures, and acted as a sensor monitoring the electric field
passing through the heterostructures (\worktodo{Figure} 2a). Subtle electric
field changes could be detected by EFM phase shift (Δϕ), which can be
described as~\cite{Li_2014_screen}:
% Δϕ=  (∂F⁄∂z)/k  ∙Q_cant      (1)
where ∂F/∂z is the local force gradient, representing the derivative of the electric force felt by the cantilever tip; k is the spring constant of the cantilever; and Qcant is the Q factor of the cantilever. For simplicity, the interaction between the cantilever tip and the sample in EFM is often viewed as an ideal capacitance. Therefore, the local force gradient due to the capacitive interaction becomes:21,22
% ∂F⁄∂z=  1/2   (∂^2 C)/(∂z^2 )  (V_s+V_CPD )^2      (2)
where C and z are the local capacitance and distance between the tip and the sample, respectively; Vs is the unscreened electric field which originated from the substrate voltage and passed through the samples, or in other words, the unscreened surface charge of the samples; VCPD is the contact potential difference due to the mismatch of the work functions between the tip and the sample. The raw data of the EFM spectroscopy from the Au substrate, 4L graphene, bulk MoS\textsubscript{2}, and three heterostructures, namely 1L MoS\textsubscript{2}/1L graphene, 2L MoS\textsubscript{2}/4L graphene, and 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}/4L graphene are shown in \worktodo{Figure} 2b. The EFM phase of all the samples formed opening-up parabolas with the axis symmetry parallel with the y-axis as a function of the DC voltage. Considering the quadratic function in Eq. 2, we were not surprised that the parabolas were recorded. As VCPD was fixed for each sample, the formation of the parabolic curves was due to the sweeping Vs. In other words, Vs was a dominant parameter in our EFM measurements. The opening-up means attractive capacitive interactions under both positive and negative voltages.21 However, the different samples gave rise to slightly different shapes of the parabolas. This was caused by the other parameters, especially C and z. The distance z was inevitably slightly different from sample to sample during the EFM spectroscopy measurements. Although the local capacitance C is very difficult to define as it depends on many factors, including the shape, size, conductivity, and dielectric property of a sample, C was different from sample to sample. Therefore, it is understandable that the different samples resulted in the slightly different parabolic shapes in EFM spectroscopy. 
Intriguingly, we found that the parabolas of the EFM phase from some heterostructures lacked the mirror-symmetry as that of a perfect parabola. We give typical examples on symmetric and asymmetric EFM phase in \worktodo{Figure} 2c-d, respectively. The EFM data from the Au substrate could be well fitted by the second-degree polynomial (grey vs. brown in \worktodo{Figure} 2c), but the same fitting process was not able to reproduce the left part (negative bias) of the EFM phase curve from 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}/4L graphene (grey vs. blue in \worktodo{Figure} 2d). To compare this phenomenon from the different samples, we normalized all the EFM data, as shown in \worktodo{Figure} 2e. The enlarged view from the dashed area in \worktodo{Figure} 2e is displayed in \worktodo{Figure} 2f. Similar to the Au substrate, the 4L graphene, bulk MoS\textsubscript{2}, and 1L MoS\textsubscript{2}/1L graphene gave rise to symmetric parabolas of the EFM phase; in contrast, the heterostructures of few-layer MoS\textsubscript{2} and graphene, i.e. 2L MoS\textsubscript{2}/4L graphene and 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}/4L graphene, showed deviated-parabolic EFM phase values under more negative substrate voltages. These EFM results were peculiar. As discussed previously, most of the parameters determining EFM phase, except Vs, should be constant during each measurement. The asymmetric parabolic EFM curves suggest that the electric field screening properties of 2L MoS\textsubscript{2}/4L graphene and 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}/4L graphene were probably not constant under different substrate voltages, i.e. external electric fields. In turn, the local capacitance C should change slightly accordingly. This phenomenon was not shown in Au film, 4L graphene, bulk MoS\textsubscript{2}, or 1L MoS\textsubscript{2}/1L graphene, but became prominent in the heterostructures with increased thickness of graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2}.

\subsection{Multiscale Theoretical modeling}
Quantum mechanical first-principle simulations To better understand
this intriguing phenomenon, we performed two levels of theoretical
analysis using quantum mechanical ab initio calculations based on
density functional theory (DFT); and at a classical level
electrostatic approach using a capacitance model based on charge
conservation equation solved variationally (see Methods for
details). We first address the quantum mechanical part of the G/MoS\textsubscript{2}
heterostructures. We calculated the degree of polarization in the vdW
heterostructures of graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2} of different number of layers in
response to the applied electric fields in terms of the electric
susceptibility . We used the quantum mechanical model presented in
\cite{Santos_2013_tunable_eps_gr,Santos_2013_ACSnano_kaxi} where a
fully based ab initio approach was employed to extract information
about the dielectric response at finite-electric fields and large
supercells. No external parameters apart from the magnitude of the
external electric fields were utilized in a self-consistent
calculation. The simulations also took into account vdW dispersion
forces, electrostatic interactions, and exchange-correlation potential
within DFT at the same footing.  \worktodo{Figure} 3(a)-(c) show the variation of
with the electric bias at 1L, 2L and 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}, respectively, but with a
distinct number of graphene layers. Strikingly, only negative bias
affected despite of the number of graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2} sheets present in
the heterostructures. This is in remarkable agreement with the
experimental results where an asymmetrical response was recorded only
from graphene and few-layer MoS\textsubscript{2} heterostructures (Fig. 2(f)). The
effect is enhanced, as more MoS\textsubscript{2} layers are included into each
graphene system. The largest increment is noticed on 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}/3L
graphene, where a four-fold enhanced magnitude of relative to zero
field was calculated (Fig. 3(c)). We also observed that graphene
layers have minor contributions to the effect, as slightly varied as
more graphene was putted together on top of MoS\textsubscript{2} (Fig. 3(d)). At a
fixed value of the electric field (-1.0 V/nm), larger asymmetric
screening was displayed as the number of MoS\textsubscript{2} layers increased: the
screening in the heterostructures containing 3L MoS\textsubscript{2} was almost
doubled that of 1L and 2L MoS\textsubscript{2} heterostructures. The slope of versus
the number of graphene layers also increased with the thickness of
MoS\textsubscript{2} (1L (0.008), 2L (0.03) and 3L (0.05)), which indicates that
thicker MoS\textsubscript{2} tends to be more correlated with variations in the number
of graphene layers. This follows the behavior observed from EFM
measurements, which heterostructures involving thicker MoS\textsubscript{2} sheets in
contact with graphene gave rise to a more asymmetric EFM phase
parabola (Fig. 2(f)). Based on these results it becomes clear that the
transition metal dichalcogenide layers play a key role on this
screening effect. We will analyze in the following the modifications
of the electronic structure of the heterostructures at finite electric
fields, and elucidate the origin of this asymmetric susceptibility
dependence on the external bias.  \worktodo{Figure} 4 shows that the behavior of
with the electric bias results from the asymmetrical polarization
associated to which side of the heterostructure the field interacts
first. At negative bias, a larger amount of induced charge was
displaced towards the surface-layers of the MoS\textsubscript{2} in the
heterostructure, which consequently generates a polarization that
provided a better screening to the external electric fields relative
to positive bias (Fig. 4(a)-(b)). As the number of MoS\textsubscript{2} layer is
small, little differences are noticed under the reversed electric
field, as the dipole moment formed at the interface roughly
compensated each other (Fig. 4(a)).  This effect is enlarged, as
thicker MoS\textsubscript{2} sheets are included. This was due to the amount of
interfacial charge redistribution, which generated electric dipole
moments preferentially aligned along one direction
(Fig. 4(b)). Electric fields pointing towards graphene were not well
screened as those towards MoS\textsubscript{2} layers, because the induced
polarization was not so efficient to generate response fields that
would shield the heterostructures completely. This means that higher
magnitudes of electric field were observed inside thinner
heterostructures, rather than thicker ones (Fig. 4(c)-(d)). We also
observed that the induced electric potential shows a smooth variation
over the interface, and it is almost independent of the number of
layers composing the junction.  displays high magnitudes over fields
towards graphene layers, with a change in polarity at the MoS\textsubscript{2} layer
near the interface with for thicker vdWHs (see Fig. 4(d)). This
indicates that the interfacial-charge balance in both systems that
generates is sensitive to the amount of polarization charge from the
MoS\textsubscript{2} layers. That is, the thicker the MoS\textsubscript{2} sheets, the larger the
polarization. A consequence of this electric field direction-dependent
polarization is noted in the different magnitudes of observed in the
vacuum region outside of 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}/3L graphene system for positive and
negative fields (Fig. 4(d)).  In electrostatic boundary conditions,
where the normal component of the displacement field has to be
preserved into the system~\cite{Meyer_2001_dipole_slab}, it gives:
where corresponds to the field in the sheets and to the induced
polarization.  It is worth noting that differs to because the latter
is calculated directly from the average induced charge using the
Poisson equation and the former directly from the boundary conditions
and the input field in the simulations (see Methods for details). For
negative fields towards MoS\textsubscript{2} layers, the second term on the right-hand
side in Eq. (3) involving the polarization is appreciably large, which
generates a depolarization or response field that would overcome the
applied external bias. This resulted in smaller electric fields inside
the heterojunction (Fig. 4(d)). A similar effect is observed to fields
directed to graphene layers, but higher in magnitudes inside the sheet
due to smaller induced polarization. The polarization at the G/MoS\textsubscript{2}
heterostructure is therefore a contributing factor in the special
screening field effect we measured by EFM.  Based on the previous
analysis, several implications on the electronic structure of the
heterojunction can be foreseen. \worktodo{Figure} 5 shows an asymmetric
electronic response with the external electric field for several
quantities. At negative bias, the induced dipole moments associated to
the S-Mo-S bonds displace the charge towards the surface of the MoS\textsubscript{2}
sheet (Fig. 5(a)), which generated charge transfer from graphene to
MoS\textsubscript{2} at the interface (Fig. 5(b)). This charge rearrangement is
smaller for positive fields because of the semiconducting nature of
the MoS\textsubscript{2} layer with less charge-carriers on its surface, and the
semi-metallic character of graphene. This results in less polarizable
field-dependent facet, smaller charge-transfer from MoS\textsubscript{2} to graphene,
and consequently better screening. The effect of the electric field
can also be noted on the tuning of the Fermi level relative to the
charge-neutrality point when no doping concentration was considered on
either graphene or MoS\textsubscript{2} (Fig. 5(c)). Thin systems (e.g. 1L MoS\textsubscript{2}/1L G)
tend to tune their Fermi level almost linearly with the electric
field, which is a property intrinsically present at the pristine
layers~\cite{Yu_2009_Tuning,Wang_2010_carrier_gr,Li_2013_WF_mos2}.  As
the number of MoS\textsubscript{2} sheets increased, displayed variations at positive
fields as large as 0.34 eV for 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}/3L G but almost negligible for
the negative electric field with the formation of a plateau at -0.2
V/nm and beyond. Such asymmetric behavior has been observed when MoS\textsubscript{2}
layers are used in metal-insulator-semiconductor
junctions~\cite{Chu_2017_eh_tunneling}. Carrier doping induced by the
electric field was responsible for the variation of the Fermi level or
the work function of MoS\textsubscript{2} mainly along one direction, which is
directly related to the unbalance of charge density between both sides
of the semimetal and the semiconductor interface. This indicates that
the intrinsic character of the electronic structure of each system in
vdW heterostructures contributes to the formation of the anisotropic
screening observed. This effect has several main implications on the
fundamental electronic structure of the G/MoS\textsubscript{2} interfaces as can be
appreciated on the band structure calculated at different magnitudes
of gate bias for a sample system (e.g. 3L MoS\textsubscript{2}/1L G) in \worktodo{Figure}
5(d)-(f). Similar trends are observed for different thicknesses of
graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2}. At 0.0 V/nm, the Fermi level crossed the Dirac
point of graphene, as no charge-imbalance was present between both
systems. Several MoS\textsubscript{2} states at the conduction band were observed at
247.86 meV relative to the Fermi level, which also corresponds to the
Schottky barrier presents at the interface~\cite{Yu_2014_gr_mos2}.
%
At
finite fields, those states are observed to shift up (down) with
positive (negative) electric bias, with a consequent split as large as
~0.20 eV. This modifies their occupation, as some graphene states can
become occupied (positive bias) or unoccupied (negative bias)
according to the field polarization. The insets in Fig. 5(c) summarize
the main effect of the bias on graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2} states near the Fermi
level.  This indicates that for electric fields toward the
dichalcogenide layer, the states mainly composed of the conduction
band of MoS\textsubscript{2} with minor contribution from graphene were responsible
for the charge-screening effect, and vice versa. This suggests the
important role of the interface on the electrical properties of the
vdW heterostructures, as the polarity of the electric field can select
which states can screen the system against external bias.



\subsection{Unifying classical and quantum approaches}
\label{sec:asym-unify}
The classical electrostatic model shows sound agreement with the ab
initio calculations in predicting the asymmetric screening behavior of
the G/MoS\textsubscript{2} vdWH, as a result of the different energy levels and DOS of
both materials. Here we further propose that such asymmetry can be
described by the quantum capacitance, within both theoretical
frameworks. The vdWH can be considered as a capacitor, characterized
by the quantum capacitance ( ), which is a function of the DOS at the
Fermi level of the whole vdWH: . The total DOS of the vdWH can be
obtained quantum mechanically at high accuracy. On the other hand, the
apparent quantum capacitance in the classical model can be calculated
by the differentiating the charge density by the potential drop across
the vacuum level (equivalent to the total difference of work functions
): . We compare the quantum capacitances calculated by the classical
model ( ) and DFT calculations ( ) as functions of inof various G/MoS\textsubscript{2}
systems in \worktodo{Figure}s 7(a) and 7(b), respectively. Interesting, the
quantum capacitances calculated by both methods show very similar
behavior under external electric field, with the maximum quantum
capacitance reaching ~30-33 in 3L G/ 3L MoS\textsubscript{2} configuration, under an
electric field of -1 V/nm. We find the layer dependency of quantum
capacitance is very similar to that of the dipole moment and charge
transfer: the layer number of MoS\textsubscript{2} is dominating the magnitude of the
total quantum capacitance under strong electric field. This is
reasonable due to the higher quantum capacitance of MoS\textsubscript{2} than graphene
when Fermi level shifts to the band edges \worktodo{ref to QC part}.
%
Note that the DFT calculations predict a non-zero quantum capacitance
of vdWHs with 2L and 3L graphene even without external electric field,
as a result of the interlayer coupling, which is not included in the
classical model. Despite the minute difference between both
theoretical frameworks, it is clear that the quantum capacitance of
the G/MoS\textsubscript{2} vdWH, as a combination of the energy levels and DOS, can
describe the asymmetric screening behavior with good precision. Our
multiscale theoretical framework is thus readily applicable for a
variety of vdWHs beyond graphene/MoS\textsubscript{2}, by utilizing the electronic
“genome”, in particular the quantum capacitances of individual 2D
layers. A full picture of electric screening of 2D vdWHs can be built
benefited from the framework proposed in this work, extending the “tip
of the iceberg” of the electrostatic nature of two-layer 2D vdWHs
revealed by recent
studies~\cite{Chu_2017_eh_tunneling,Lee_2014_pn_vdw_het,Furchi_2014_PV_vdwH}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:asym-conclusions}


In summary, our findings reveal fundamental knowledge of the screening
properties of van der Waals heterostructures using widely used
two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2}. Graphene/MoS\textsubscript{2}
constitutes an archetypal of vdW heterostructure with exciting
possibilities for electronic devices based on atomically thin films.
We have shown an asymmetric electric field response on the screening
properties of G/MoS\textsubscript{2} stackings via high-resolution EFM spectroscopy
and a multiscale theoretical analysis that involve quantum mechanical
ab initio density functional theory including vdW dispersion forces,
and a classical capacitor modelelectrostatic approach considering the
quantum capacitance.  Our ab initio calculations are further unified
in a quantum capacitance-based model, showing that the difference
between the energy levels and band structures between graphene and
MoS\textsubscript{2} is account for the asymmetric screening behavior. After the
transfer of MoS\textsubscript{2} on graphene, the screening of either isolated
graphene or MoS\textsubscript{2} changes accordingly to the sign of the electric bias
utilized becoming polarity-dependent. The EFM phase spectrum shows an
asymmetry with the substrate voltage as the number of MoS\textsubscript{2} layers
increases relative to that of the graphene. Electric fields towards
MoS\textsubscript{2} tend to be better screened than those directed to graphene as an
asymmetrical polarization associated to charge transfer at the
graphene/MoS\textsubscript{2} interface generate response fields that opposed to
external bias. Such charge rearrangement also polarized the interface
inducing the appearance of dipole moments and consequently giving a
directional character to the underlying electronic structure. In
particular, external fields in such vdW heterostructures can select
which electronic states can be used to screen the gate bias, which
clearly give an external control on the screening properties according
to the stacking order and thickness. Our computational-experimental
framework paves the way to understand and engineer the electronic and
dielectric properties of a broad class of 2D materials assembled in
heterojunctions for different technological applications, such as
optoelectronics and plasmonics.

Both classical and DFT calculations show similar trend of relationship between layer numbers and quantum capacitance: the layer numbers of MoS\textsubscript{2} contributes more to the total quantum capacitance than graphene under strong electric field, consistent with the findings of layer-dependent dipole moment and charge transfer. 

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:asym-methods}

\subsection{Experimental Procedures}
\label{sec:asym-exper-proc}

The graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2} nanosheets were mechanically exfoliated by Scotch tape. Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) (Momentive, US) and synthetic MoS\textsubscript{2} crystals (2D Semiconductors, US) were used as received. Si wafers with 90 and 270 nm thick thermal SiO\textsubscript{2} were used for graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2}, respectively. An Olympus optical microscopy (BX51) equipped with a DP71 camera was used to search atomically thin nanosheets, and a Cypher AFM (Asylum Research, US) was employed for topography measurements. The Raman spectra were collected by a Renishaw Raman microscope using 514.5 nm (for MoS\textsubscript{2}) and 633 nm (for graphene) lasers and an objective lens of 100× (a numerical aperture of 0.9). For the fabrication of the heterostructure, the identified MoS\textsubscript{2} nanosheets were firstly coated by thin layer of PMMA, then peeled off from the SiO\textsubscript{2}/Si via etching by NaOH, stacked on graphene on SiO\textsubscript{2}/Si under the optical microscope. The MoS\textsubscript{2}/graphene structure was transferred to Au (100 nm) coated SiO\textsubscript{2}/Si substrate following a similar procedure. The Au coating was produced by a Leica ACE600 sputter with a crystal balance monitoring the coating thickness in real time. The EFM measurements were conducted on the Cypher AFM. The EFM phase data were collected by a Pt/Ti coated cantilever with a spring constant of ~2 N/m (ElectricLever, Asylum Research, US) dwelling above the heterostructure at a sampling rate of 2 kHz, while a voltage sweeping linearly from +9 to −9 V was applied on the Au substrate over a period of 20 s.

\subsection{	Ab initio simulations}
\label{sec:ab-init-simul}
\worktodo{change afterwards}
Ab initio quantum calculations
Calculations were based on ab initio density functional theory using the SIESTA41 and the VASP codes.42,43 Projected augmented wave method (PAW)44,45 for the latter, and norm-conserving (NC) Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials46 for the former, have been used in the description of the bonding environment for Mo, S and C. The shape of the numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs) was automatically determined by the algorithms described in41. The generalized gradient approximation47 along with the DRSLL48 functional was used in both methods, together with a double-zeta polarized basis set in Siesta, and a well-converged plane-wave cutoff of 500 eV in VASP. The cutoff radii of the different orbitals in SIESTA were obtained using an energy shift of 50 meV, which proved to be sufficiently accurate to describe the geometries and the energetics. Atoms were allowed to relax under the conjugate-gradient algorithm until the forces acting on the atoms were less than 1x10-8 eV/Å. The self-consistent field (SCF) convergence was also set to 1.0x10-8 eV. To model the system studied in the experiments, we created large supercells containing up to 394 atoms to simulate the interface between different number of graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2} layers. We have optimized the supercell for the G/MoS\textsubscript{2} interface using a 55 graphene cell on a 44 MoS\textsubscript{2} cell, where the mismatch between different lattice constants is smaller than ~2.0% (i.e. the systems are commensurate). We have kept the lattice constant of the MoS\textsubscript{2} at equilibrium, and stretched the one for graphene by that amount. Negligible variations of the graphene electronic properties are observed with the preservation of the Dirac cone for all systems. To avoid any interactions between supercells in the non-periodic direction, a 20 Å vacuum space was used in all calculations. In addition to this, a cutoff energy of 120 Ry was used to resolve the real-space grid used to calculate the Hartree and exchange correlation contribution to the total energy in SIESTA. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 9×9×1 grid under the Monkhorst-Pack scheme49 to perform relaxations with and without van der Waals interactions. Energetics and electronic band structure were calculated using a converged 44×44×1 k-sampling for the unit cell of Graphene/MoS\textsubscript{2}. In addition to this we used a Fermi-Dirac distribution with an electronic temperature of kBT = 20 meV to resolve the electronic structure. 
The electric field   across the vdW heterostructures is simulated using a spatially periodic sawtooh-like potential   perpendicular to the G/MoS\textsubscript{2} heterostructures. Such potential is convenient to analyze the response of finite systems (e.g. slabs) to electric fields22,50-52, while problematic for extended systems (e.g. bulk).  The magnitudes of the spatially varying electrostatic potential and charge density   across the supercell are determined via a convolution with a filter function to eliminate undesired oscillations and conserve the main features important in the analysis. The variations of both quantities,  and  are determined relative to zero field. The polarization   is calculated by the integration of   through  .   is defined through   where   , with   the thickness of the vdW heterostructure, and    the height of the supercell~\cite{Santos_2013_ACSnano_kaxi,Santos_2013_tunable_eps_gr}.

\worktodo{merge the classical method to previous sections}
ClassicalMean-field Model
In the classicalmean-field model, the graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2} layers are treated as individual layers, with the the band structures (band gap, DOS and intrinsic work functions) considered as invariable to external electric field (i.e. the effect interlayer coupling on band structure is neglected). We further consider that the interlayer distance  between the i-1 and i-th layers is fixed, and taken as the interlayer distance in DFT calculations under zero field. The interlayer dielectric constant  between the i-1 and i-th layer is considered as uniform. For simplicity, we consider that  is independent of the external field, while the current model can be easily adapted for field-dependent dielectric constant in multilayer 2D materials using ab initio calculation results. We consider the interlayer electric field   to be uniform. The charge density   and work function   of each layer can thus be solved through the following conservation equations in a self-consistent way:
	The charge neutrality of the vdWH:
	Charge balance of the i-th layer by Gauss law:
	 as a function of the work function  of i-th layer:
Where   is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, and   is the intrinsic work function of the i-th layer. 
	The potential drop between 2 adjacent layers:

Note that for individual layers,   . We simplify the quantum capacitance of graphene using a linear model:  , while the quantum capacitance of MoS\textsubscript{2} is a step function where no density of states exist within the band gap, while  and   for VB and CB, respectively. The intrinsic work function of graphene and MoS\textsubscript{2} are set at 4.6 V and 4.5 V, respectively. The energy levels of CB and VB of MoS\textsubscript{2} are taken as -4.0 eV and -5.8 eV, respectively.
