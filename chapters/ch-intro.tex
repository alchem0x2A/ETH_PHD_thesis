\section{Overview of Two-Dimensional (2D) Materials}
% \section{Introduction}
\label{sec:ch-intro-2D}
Controlling the dimensionality of materials provides rich
opportunities of tuning the electronic, optical and mechanical
properties which facilitates novel devices and applications.
\worktodo{put more things inside and make claim clear} \worktodo{put
  1-3 refs}. Good example of such material design are the
two-dimensional (2D) materials, which are covalently-bonded
crystalline films with only one- or few-atom thickness. \worktodo{HH??

%
Starting from the first discovering of graphene, an allotrope of
carbon in 2004\worktodo{cite Geim}, the family of 2D materials has
expanded significantly throughout the last decade. \worktodo{cite
  Novoselov and 2 papers} The electronic properties of 2D materials
cover a wide spectrum ranging from insulators to superconductors,
making them promising candidates to replace conventional bulk
materials in semiconductor industries. \worktodo{cite 1-2}.
%
This section aims to give a brief introduction about the structures,
electronic properties and fabrication techniques, which serves as a
prelude for introducing the 2D materials interfaces.
\worktodo{again, change last part}

% Understanding and engineering the
% interfaces of 2D materials are important to achieve practical uses of
% 2D materials in our 3D world. In this chapter, we briefly discuss the
% fundamental aspects of 2D materials and introduce their interfacial
% phenomena. Several challenges about the 2D materials interfaces are
% also discussed, serving as the prelude to the work of this thesis.


\subsection{Categories of 2D Materials}
\label{sec:categ-2d-mater}

So far, there have been no naturally-existing isolated 2D
materials. The closest form is the layered bulk materials, in which
interlayer interactions are governed by van der Waals (vdW) forces.
%
With proper separation techniques, these layered materials can be
thinned to a few layers or even single layer.
%
The best-known example is the mechanical exfoliation of 2D layer from graphite,
now known as graphene. \worktodo{cite geim}
%
Using such technique, monolayers exfoliated from naturally-existing
layered bulk materials were achievable. Examples include the hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs, with
general chemical composition MX\textsubscript{2}, where M is a
transition metal and X is S, Se or Te), monochalcogenides (GaS, GaSe),
monolayer black phosophorus (BP) and MXene (M = Ti, Nb, V, Ta, etc.,
X = C or N).
%
The family of 2D materials that have been experimentally discovered,
has extended from only 1 in 2004 to over 100 \worktodo{really?} as of
2019, corresponding to an average discovery of about 6 new materials
each year. \worktodo{correct?}
%
Apparently, the known 2D materials are still scarce and limited
compared with the bulk materials,
due to the huge experimental effort
required to synthesize, isolate and characterize 2D materials limit
the speed of novel 2D material discovery.
% 
In view of this, computer-aided material design (CAMD) was
demonstrated in several works to help find new 2D materials either
from high-throughput materials database screening or \textit{ab
  initio} calculations. As a pioneer study, Leb√®gue et al. performed
data mining on the crystal structures listed in the International
Crystallographic Structural Database (ICSD) to filter out a total
number of 92 layered bulk crystals and to generate corresponding 2D
materials. As an extension, Mounet et al. proposed new algorithm with
more robust criteria for dimensionality and found over 5000 layered
materials, among which over 1800 can be easily or potentially
exfoliated according to \textit{ab initio} calculations.
%
Another example is the combinational design of new 2D materials, which
starts with a known structure (for example MX\textsubscript{2}) and
replace with other elements. This allows the discovery of over 3700
thermo-dynamically stable 2D materials, among which most chemical
compositions are not yet discovered experimentally.

These computational studies broaden our knowledge about 2D
materials. In particular, the large size of database allows
systematical study to search for optimal 2D material according to
their electronic and optical properties, and apply to real-world
applications. As a summary, the most common types of 2D materials from
either experimental or computational discoveries, are listed in
\autoref{tab:category-2D}.
