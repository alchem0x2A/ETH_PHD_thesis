\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:vdw-introduction}
% 20191014-1539
The van der Waals (vdW) interactions are inter\-atomic /
inter\-molecular forces that stem from the electromagnetic (EM)
fluctuations~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book,Woods_2016_rev_vdw,parsegian_van_2010_book}.
%
Unlike trivial electrostatic (Coulombic) forces that depends on the
charge stat, the vdW interaction has a complex electro\-dynamic
origin, and acts ubiquitously between all atoms and molecules,
regardless of their charge
state~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book,Hermann_2017_vdW_rev}.
%
As briefly discussed in \autoref{sec:inter-forc-at}, although being a
relatively weak force, the vdW interactions can be dominating at
molecule-2D interface due to the absence of dangling bonds.
%
The understanding and engineering of the vdW interactions at the 2D
material interface would greatly benefit molecular
self-assembly~\cite{Kumar_2017_rev_assemb_2D},
electronic~\cite{Wang_2015_phys_chem_tuning_TMDC,Lazar_2013} as well
as optical properties~\cite{Geim_2013_2D_vdw_Het,Novoselov_2016_vdW}
of 2D material-based hetero\-structures.
%
\worktodo{try to say more about the dielectric properties}

As introduced in \autoref{sec:van-der-waals}, one particular question
of interest is the transmission of vdW interactions through the
atomically-thin 2D materials.
%
The effective distance of vdW forces, depending on the medium, can
vary from sub-nm 10$^{1}$ nm~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book}, and are
relatively longer compared with the sub-nm thickness of 2D materials.
%
Therefore, the vdW forces from an macroscopic substrate may
(partially) penetrate through the 2D layer and be felt by an molecule
on the 2D material interface~\cite{shih_2013_wetting_natmat}.
%
This feature
brings potentially unprecedented surface properties by simply coating
an existing bulk surface with 2D
material(s)~\cite{Prasai_2012_coating,rafiee_2012_transparency,Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D}.
%
Based on classic pair-wise model~\cite{Hamaker_1937_vdW} of vdW
forces, the interaction free energy per area $\Phi_{\mathrm{vdW}}$,
between two semi-infinite bulk bodies (A and B) separated by distance
$d$, is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vdw-hamaker-res}
  \Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} = - \frac{A_{\mathrm{AB}}}{12 \pi d^{2}}
\end{equation}
where $A_{\mathrm{AB}}$ is known as the Hamaker constant of vdW
interactions between materials A and B.
%
A quantitative statement can be drawn from such simple model: by inserting a 2D material (\eg graphene
with thickness $\sim{}$3.3 \AA{}~\cite{Shearer_2016}) between two bulk
bodies (3$\sim{}$5 \AA{} \worktodo{cite 1 here}), 20--40\% of the vdW
interactions can still penetrate through the 2D layer.
%
Several unprecedented phenomena concerning the interfacial vdW forces
on 2D materials take credit from the analysis above, including wetting
transparency / translucency
\cite{Shih_2012_prl,rafiee_2012_transparency,Gurarslan_2016_screen_MoS2} and remote
epitaxy \cite{Kim_2017_remote_epi_Gr,Kong_2018_pol}.

Despite the seemingly accordance with experimental observations in
these studies, the prerequisites for the classical model are the
perfect additivity of vdW interactions, and a constant
$A_{\mathrm{AB}}$. 
%
In other words, the classic model assumes that the existence of the
2DEG has no influence on the EM waves that arise from charge
fluctuations.
%
Such picture is however challenged by recent experimental
\cite{Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D} and first-principles
\cite{Ambrosetti_2018_carbon,Liu_2018_gr,Li_2018_screen} studies,
revealing the 2D material-dependent Hamaker coefficient.
%
To correctly capture the many-body picture of vdW interactions at 2D
material interfaces, electro\-dynamic effects beyond the classic model
is needed.
%
In practice, this is usually a challenging task, since state-of-art
density functional theory (DFT) used for first principle simulations
is limited ground state electron density, intrinsically lacking charge
fluctuation~\cite{Woods_2016_rev_vdw}.
%
On the other hand, full-scale interaction energy calculations based on
dynamic non-local dielectric responses are usually time-consuming and
only limited to small
systems.~\cite{Hermann_2017_vdW_rev,Zhou_2017_lifshitz}
%
Therefore, novel theoretical frameworks with both appreciable accuracy
while maintaining simplicity, is of high demand to shed light on the
vdW interactions at 2D material interfaces.

In this chapter, we present
the a generalized model to study the many-body vdW transmission
through 2D materials, based on the modified Lifshitz-vdW theory
\cite{Dzyaloshinskii_1961_lifshitz,parsegian_van_2010_book}.
%
Based on the model, the vdW transmission through a 2D material is
selective, such that a 2D material acts as a high-pass filter of vdW
interaction, filtering the low-frequency interactions.
%
Such phenomenon is related with the anisotropic dielectric nature (\worktodo{ref to chapter
  5}).
%
We further show that such effect is concerted by the bandgap of both the
2D and bulk materials through both large-scale material database
screening.
%
More interestingly, repulsive vdW interactions are possible with careful dielectric engineering of the 2D material interface.
%
As a preliminary experimental demonstration, we show that the such
repulsive vdW forces can be indirectly probed using molecular epitaxy
on gold-supported graphene surfaced, as backed by the model presented
here.

\section{Modified Lifshitz-vdW Model For 2D Material Interfaces}
\label{sec:vdw-model-lifshitz}
% 20191014-1529

\subsection{Generalized Model For Layered Anisotropic Media}
\label{sec:vdw-gener-model-layer}

\worktodo{Add scheme here}
We start the discussion in a system with simplified geometry: consider
two infinitely-large bulk materials (A and B) separated by a medium m
at distance \(d\), the total many-body interaction potential between A
and B over m, \(\Phi\), consists of the contributions from vdW
interactions \(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) and mono\-polar surface
interactions \(\Phi^{\pm}\)
\cite{van_Oss_1987_monopolar,Van_Oss_1988}, such that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-phi-oss}
\Phi = \Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} + \Phi^{\pm}
\end{equation}
where \(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) includes the Keesom (dipole -- dipole),
Debye (dipole -- induced dipole) and London dispersion (induced dipole
-- induced dipole) interactions~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book}, while
\(\Phi^{\pm}\) originates from interfacial monopoles (Coulomb
interactions) \cite{van_Oss_1987_monopolar}.
%
Note that $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ and $\Phi^{\pm}$ are all relative
energy scales compared with the infinitely-separated systems.
%
From the Lifshitz-vdW theory \cite{Dzyaloshinskii_1961_lifshitz},
\(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) stems from the fluctuations of electromagnetic
(EM) field, and can be regarded as the sum of oscillatory surface EM
mode energies, when the length scale of interest is larger than
atomistic details.
%
When the vdW contribution dominates (\ie chemically inert surface),
and retardation effect (due to limited speed of light, usually seen at
distance $>$20 nm~\cite{parsegian_van_2010_book}) can be ignored,
$\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ is total energy summed from all allowed EM modes
\cite{Li_2005_diele}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-EM-energy}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} = k_{\mathrm{B}} T \sum_{j} \ln \left[2 \sinh\left(\frac{\hbar \omega_{j}(\mathbf{k})}{2 k_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right)\right] 
\end{equation}
where \(\omega_{j}\) is EM frequencies of allowed mode $j$ that
corresponds to the (i) geometry and dielectric profile of the system
and (ii) the in-plane wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\).
%
The system-specific information of the EM modes can be generalized by
writing the dispersion relation ($\mathcal{D}$)of system, such that
\(\mathcal{D}(\omega_{j}(\mathbf{k})) \equiv
0\)~\cite{Guttinger_1966_dispersion,Mahanty_1976_dispersion_book}.
%
Analyzing the mode frequency \(\omega_{j}\) is usually a non-trivial
task, while on the other hand, using the Cauchy integral theorem, the
integral in \autoref{eq:vdw-EM-energy} is equivalent to the summation
over the imaginary Matsubara frequencies $\xi$
\cite{Mahanty_1976_dispersion_book} as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-lifshitz-general-2}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} = \frac{1}{2} k_{\mathrm{B}} T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{\mathbf{k}}\ln \mathcal{D}(i \xi_{n}, \mathbf{k})
= k_{\mathrm{B}} T \sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \ln \mathcal{D}(i \xi_{n}, \mathbf{k})
\end{equation}
where \(k_{\mathrm{B}}\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(T\) is
temperature, \(\xi_{n} = 2 \pi n k_{\mathrm{B}} T / \hbar\) is the n-th
Matsubara frequency and the prime in the summation refers to the
prefactor of 1/2 when \(n=0\). Here we assume the dispersion relation
\(\mathcal{D}\) has time-reverse symmetry, i.e.
\(\mathcal{D}(i\xi, \mathbf{k}) = \mathcal{D}(-i\xi, \mathbf{k})\).
%
The summation over \(\mathbf{k}\) can be further carried out in
continuous integral if the system is infinitely large
%
For the 3-layer system considered here (refer to AmB in the remaining
text) that is infinite in \textit{xy}-direction while non-periodic in
\textit{z}-direction, the summation over \(\mathbf{k}\) in
\autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-general-2} can be written using in-plane wave
vector \(\mathbf{k} = (k_{x}, k_{y})\):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-lifshitz-integral}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} = \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \sideset{}{'} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} \ln \mathcal{D}(i\xi_{n}, \mathbf{k}) \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{k}
\end{equation}
%
While along the \textit{z}-direction, the electrostatic potential
\(\psi\) follows the Poisson-Laplace equation, such that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-poisson-laplace}
\nabla \cdot [ \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}(\mathbf{r}, z) \cdot \nabla \psi]
= -\rho(\mathbf{r}, z) = 0
\end{equation}
where \(\mathbf{r}=(x, y)\) is the in-plane coordinates,
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}$ is the dielectric tensor of each material,
and \(\rho\) is the free charge density in the system, and for van der
Waals interactions alone, \(\rho \equiv 0\).
%
The periodicity of the \textit{xy}-plane leads to the form of
plane-wave form of $\psi$~\cite{parsegian_van_2010_book}\worktodo{if
  cite is correct?}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-deriv-pot-pw}
\psi(\mathbf{r}, z) =  
f(z) e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} 
\end{equation}
where \(f(z)\) is the variation in the \emph{z}-dierction.
%
Here we use a mean-field assumption that $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}$ is
uniform inside each material \worktodo{cite if this is proper}.
%
Due to the dielectric anisotropy discussed in \worktodo{ref to
  previous section}, we consider a general case, that in material $i$,
the dielectric tensor $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}$ consists of different
diagonal components \(\varepsilon^{xx}\), \(\varepsilon^{yy}\) and
\(\varepsilon^{zz}\). \autoref{eq:vdw-poisson-laplace} for individual
layer now writes:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-laplace-2}
\varepsilon_{i}^{zz} \frac{\partial^{2} f_{i}(z)}{\partial z^{2}}
- (k_{x}^{2} \varepsilon_{i}^{xx} + k_{y}^{2} \varepsilon_{i}^{yy}) f_{i}(z)
\end{equation}
which is further simplified to:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-laplace-3}
\frac{\partial^{2} f_{i}(z)}{\partial z^{2}}
- g_{i}^{2}(\vartheta) \kappa^{2} f_{i}(z) =0
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ and $\vartheta$ are the polar coordinates of
$\mathbf{k}$ such that
\(\mathbf{k} = (\kappa \cos\mathcal{\vartheta}, \kappa\sin
\mathcal{\vartheta})\), and
\(g_{i}^{2} = {\displaystyle
  [\frac{\varepsilon_{i}^{xx}}{\varepsilon_{i}^{zz}} \cos^{2}
  \vartheta + \frac{\varepsilon_{i}^{yy}}{\varepsilon_{i}^{zz}}
  \sin^{2} \vartheta]}\).
%
\(g_{i}^{2}\) characterizes the dielectric anisotropy of medium $i$
and upscales the wavevector modulus \(\kappa\). Note for an isotropic
medium, $g_{\mathrm{m}}\equiv1$. \worktodo{modify this
  sentence}\worktodo{need to unify the anisotropy with last chapter}

% 
Following the similar procedure of dispersion relations in isotropic
systems \cite{parsegian_van_2010_book}, the dispersion relation
\worktodo{add something in the brackets} of an AmB layered system with
dielectric anisotropy is written as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-disper-D}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{D}
&=
1 - 
\underbrace{\left[
\frac{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{A}} - \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} g_{m}(\vartheta) }{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{A}} + \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta)}
\right]}_{\Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}}
\underbrace{\left[
\frac{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{B}} - \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta) }{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{B}} + \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta)}
\right]}_{\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}}
e^{-2 g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta) \kappa d} \\
&= 1 - \Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}(\vartheta) \Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}(\vartheta) e^{-2 g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta) \kappa d}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where \(\hat{\varepsilon}_{i}\) is the geometric averaged dielectric
function of material $i$ ($i$=A, m or B), $\Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}$ and
$\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}$ are the dielectric mismatch between Am and Bm
interfaces, respectively.  Combining
with~\autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-integral}, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final}
\begin{aligned}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}
&= \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \mathrm{d}\vartheta
\int_{0}^{\infty} \kappa \mathrm{d}\kappa 
\ln[1 - \Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}(\vartheta) 
\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}(\vartheta) e^{-2 g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta) \kappa d}] \\
&= \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{16 \pi^{2} d^{2}}
\sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} 
\frac{1}{g^{2}_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta)}\mathrm{d}\vartheta
\int_{0}^{\infty} x \mathrm{d}x
\ln[1 - \Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}(\vartheta) \Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}(\vartheta) e^{-x}] \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the last step is obtained using an auxiliary variable \(x = 2
g_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathcal{\theta}) \kappa d\).
%
\worktodo{add figure about convergence}
%
The integral in \autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final} is dominated by
the contributions from $x < 5$, and its convergence is almost
independent of $\Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}$ or $\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}$. In
other words, the contributions from high-\textbf{k} regime to the
total vdW interactions, is negligible.  \worktodo{think about this
  figure}

An important feature of \autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final} is that
the total energy $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ can be greatly attenuated
through a medium with high dielectric anisotropy (\ie
$g_{\mathrm{m}} \gg 1$).
%
Such high dielectric anisotropy between in- and out-of-plane
permittivities (giant birefringence) is only possible to achieve using
layered \cite{Collin_1958_aniso,Weber_2000_aniso} or low-dimensional
\cite{Niu_2018_aniso,Segura_2018_aniso} materials. Inspired by this,
by inserting a 2D material between bulk materials A and B, the
many-body \worktodo{hyphen or not?} vdW interactions may also be
screened by the high dielectric anisotropy, which contradicts with the classical theory of vdW interactions. \worktodo{another subfigure}
%
In the next section, we extend the modified Lifshitz-vdW model in
order to be applied to 2D material-containing systems.


\subsection{Applying Model to 2D Material Systems}
\label{sec:vdw-model-2D}
% 20191014-2027

The general model presented in \autoref{sec:vdw-model-2D} can be
extended to model the many body vdW transmission through 2D material
systems.
%
The exact solution to the many-body vdW interaction energy of such
mixed-dimensional system requires the knowledge of the full
spatially-varied permittivity profile \cite{Podgornik_2004_continuum},
which can be cumbersome to compute.
%
Instead, we use a mean-field treatment for
the dielectric response of the medium, Inspired by the concept in
\worktodo{ref to previous section}, if medium m consists of a layer of
2D sheet and surrounding vacuum, the average dielectric response
inside the medium m can be calculated using the effective medium
approach, using the 2D polarizability. \worktodo{ref to the equation}
%
Note here two assumptions are made: (i) the dielectric properties of
the 2D material is not influenced by the bulk material (\ie no
substrate doping and interfacial coupling) and (ii) the length scale
of the gap ($d$) is larger than the intrinsic thickness of the 2D
material, such that an uniform description of $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}$ is acceptable.
%
Since both criteria can be fulfilled at larger separation
distance~\cite{Dobson_2012_rev} (\eg $d>$1 nm), when the overlapping
between electron clouds of individual materials are negligible, we
limit our discussions in this regime throughout this chapter.
%
Moreover, As discussed above, the total vdW interaction energy is dominated by
the EM modes at $x \leq 5$, or equivalently
\(\kappa \leq 2.5 (g_{\mathrm{m}} d)^{-1}\).
%
When $d$ is at the order of 2 nm, and the typical anisotropy value for
a 2D material $g_{\mathrm{m}}=2.5$, we see that the majority of interaction comes
from EM modes with \(\kappa<0.0625\) \(\mathrm{\AA{}}^{-1}\), close to the optical limit ($k\to0$).
%
Within this regime, $\alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}$ of the 2D material as well
as $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{B}}$ of bulk
materials can be regarded as
constant~\cite{Li_2005_diele}.
%
In other words, the calculation of $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ only requires
dielectric data at the optical limit, which greatly simplifies the
computational expense.\worktodo{refine sentence, fine 1 more citation}

A large variety of 2D materials (\eg materials with P6/mmm,
P$\overline{6}$m2, P$\overline{3}$m1, \worktodo{cite more symmetries}
symmetries) has isotropic in-plane electronic polarizabilities (\ie
$\alpha^{xx}_{\mathrm{2D}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}^{yy} = \alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}^{\parallel}$) due to
symmetric electronic structure. For an AmB system constructed by these
materials, we have
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{xx} =
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{,}}^{yy}=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}$,
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} = \varepsilon_{\mathrm{2D}}^{\perp}$ ,
and $g_{\mathrm{m}}$ independent of $\vartheta$. As a result,
\autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final} can be simplified to:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}[t]
\label{eq:vdw-Phi-aniso-main}
\Phi &= \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{8 \pi d^{2}} 
\sideset{}{'} \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}(i \xi_{n})}
\int_{0}^{\infty} x \ln\left[1 - \hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Am}}(i \xi_{n}) \hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Bm}}(i \xi_{n}) e^{-x}\right] \mathrm{d} x \\
\hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{jm}}(i\xi) &= \frac{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{j}}(i\xi_{n}) -
\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{m}}(i\xi_{n})}{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{j}}(i\xi_{n}) +
\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{m}}(i\xi_{n})},\ \mathrm{j=A, B}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\(\hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{jm}}\) represents the
$\vartheta$-independent interfacial dielectric mismatch between
materials $j$ (either A or B) and m.
%
Using \autoref{eq:vdw-Phi-aniso-main} (or
\autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final}), the calculation of
$\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ can be simplified with only frequency dielectric
properties $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{A}}$, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{B}}$ and
$\alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}$ \worktodo{optic or
  optical?}, and distance $d$.
%


The dielectric function of bulk materials are obtained from both
experimental spectroscopy data~\cite{Palik_1998_handbook} and first
principles simulations, while the electronic polarizability of 2D
materials are solely from first principles simulations due to the
problem with experimentally measured optical properties of 2D
materials as mention in \worktodo{ref to previous section}. Note the
proposed model requires the use of dielectric function
($\varepsilon_{j}(i \xi_{\mathrm{n}})$) and electronic polarizability
($\alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}(i \xi_{n})$) at imaginary Matsubara
frequencies. These data can be converted using the Kramers-Kronig
relations (KKR) from data on real frequency ($\varepsilon_{j}()$)

\subsection{High-Pass vdW Transmission Through 2D Materials}
\label{sec:high-pass-vdw}

As schematically shown in Figure \ref{fig1}b left, for a typical 2D
medium, \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}\) greatly exceeds
\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\perp}\) at low frequency range, while the
difference diminishes when frequency increases, and both dielectric
functions approach unity. The frequency-dependent dielectric decay can
be characterized by the transition frequency \(\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}\),
defined as the frequency that \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}(i
\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}) - 1 =
\frac{1}{2}[\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}(i\xi=0) - 1]\), which is in
general lower for in-plane polarization
(\(\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\parallel}\)) than out-of-plane
(\(\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\perp}\)) (details see Supplementary Section XX).
 As a result, \(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}\) is nonlinear in the frequency
domain with its transition frequency close to
\(\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\parallel}\) (Figure \ref{fig1}b right, details see
Supplementary Section XX), and such phenomenon is universal for 2D
materials. As shown in Figure \ref{fig1}c, for the 2D materials studied,
\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}\) is usually much larger than
\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\perp}\) at \(d\) = 2 nm.
Interestingly, we find distinct behaviors of the transition
frequencies: \(\hbar \xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\parallel}\) is almost linearly
correlated with the electronic bandgap of 2D material
\(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}\), while \(\hbar
\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\perp}\) appears to be independent of
\(E_{\mathrm{g}}\) (Figure \ref{fig1}c insets). In addition, our analysis
shows \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}\) generally becomes higher
with decreasing \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}\), while
\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\perp}\) shows almost no dependency (see
Supplementary Section XX).
As a result, \(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}\) is dominated by \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}\). In other words, 2D materials with smaller bandgap exhibit better screening
effect, as seen in Figure \ref{fig1}d. As an example, we highlight the
profiles corresponding to graphene (Gr), 2H molybdenum disulfide
(2H-MoS\textsubscript{2}) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), clearly showing the
ranking of \(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}\) as Gr \textless{} 2H-MoS\textsubscript{2} \textless{} h-BN, due to the ascending order of bandgap.
