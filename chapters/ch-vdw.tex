\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:vdw-introduction}
% 20191014-1539
The van der Waals (vdW) interactions are inter\-atomic /
inter\-molecular forces that stem from the electromagnetic (EM)
fluctuations~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book,Woods_2016_rev_vdw,parsegian_van_2010_book}.
%
Unlike trivial electrostatic (Coulombic) forces that depends on the
charge stat, the vdW interaction has a complex electro\-dynamic
origin, and acts ubiquitously between all atoms and molecules,
regardless of their charge
state~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book,Hermann_2017_vdW_rev}.
%
As briefly discussed in \autoref{sec:inter-forc-at}, although being a
relatively weak force, the vdW interactions can be dominating at
molecule-2D interface due to the absence of dangling bonds.
%
The understanding and engineering of the vdW interactions at the 2D
material interface would greatly benefit molecular
self-assembly~\cite{Kumar_2017_rev_assemb_2D},
electronic~\cite{Wang_2015_phys_chem_tuning_TMDC,Lazar_2013} as well
as optical properties~\cite{Geim_2013_2D_vdw_Het,Novoselov_2016_vdW}
of 2D material-based hetero\-structures.

\worktodo{try to say more about the dielectric properties}

As introduced in \autoref{sec:van-der-waals}, one particular question
of interest is the transmission of vdW interactions through the
atomically-thin 2D materials.
%
The effective distance of vdW forces, depending on the medium, can
vary from sub-nm 10$^{1}$ nm~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book}, and are
relatively longer compared with the sub-nm thickness of 2D materials.
%
Therefore, the vdW forces from an macroscopic substrate may
(partially) penetrate through the 2D layer and be felt by an molecule
on the 2D material interface~\cite{shih_2013_wetting_natmat}.
%
This feature
brings potentially unprecedented surface properties by simply coating
an existing bulk surface with 2D
material(s)~\cite{Prasai_2012_coating,rafiee_2012_transparency,Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D}.
%
Based on classic pair-wise model~\cite{Hamaker_1937_vdW} of vdW
forces, the interaction free energy per area $\Phi_{\mathrm{vdW}}$,
between two semi-infinite bulk bodies (A and B) separated by distance
$d$, is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vdw-hamaker-res}
  \Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} = - \frac{A_{\mathrm{AB}}}{12 \pi d^{2}}
\end{equation}
where $A_{\mathrm{AB}}$ is known as the Hamaker constant of vdW
interactions between materials A and B.
%
A quantitative statement can be drawn from such simple model: by inserting a 2D material (\eg graphene
with thickness $\sim{}$3.3 \AA{}~\cite{Shearer_2016}) between two bulk
bodies (3$\sim{}$5 \AA{} \worktodo{cite 1 here}), 20--40\% of the vdW
interactions can still penetrate through the 2D layer.
%
Several unprecedented phenomena concerning the interfacial vdW forces
on 2D materials take credit from the analysis above, including wetting
transparency / translucency
\cite{Shih_2012_prl,rafiee_2012_transparency,Gurarslan_2016_screen_MoS2} and remote
epitaxy \cite{Kim_2017_remote_epi_Gr,Kong_2018_pol}.

Despite the seemingly accordance with experimental observations in
these studies, the prerequisites for the classical model are the
perfect additivity of vdW interactions, and a constant
$A_{\mathrm{AB}}$. 
%
In other words, the classic model assumes that the existence of the
2DEG has no influence on the EM waves that arise from charge
fluctuations.
%
Such picture is however challenged by recent experimental
\cite{Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D} and first-principles
\cite{Ambrosetti_2018_carbon,Liu_2018_gr,Li_2018_screen} studies,
revealing the 2D material-dependent Hamaker coefficient.
%
To correctly capture the many-body picture of vdW interactions at 2D
material interfaces, electro\-dynamic effects beyond the classic model
is needed.
%
In practice, this is usually a challenging task, since state-of-art
density functional theory (DFT) used for first principle simulations
is limited ground state electron density, intrinsically lacking charge
fluctuation~\cite{Woods_2016_rev_vdw}.
%
On the other hand, full-scale interaction energy calculations based on
dynamic non-local dielectric responses are usually time-consuming and
only limited to small
systems.~\cite{Hermann_2017_vdW_rev,Zhou_2017_lifshitz}
%
Therefore, novel theoretical frameworks with both appreciable accuracy
while maintaining simplicity, is of high demand to shed light on the
vdW interactions at 2D material interfaces.

In this chapter, we present
the a generalized model to study the many-body vdW transmission
through 2D materials, based on the modified Lifshitz-vdW theory
\cite{Dzyaloshinskii_1961_lifshitz,parsegian_van_2010_book}.
%
Based on the model, the vdW transmission through a 2D material is
selective, such that a 2D material acts as a high-pass filter of vdW
interaction, filtering the low-frequency interactions.
%
Such phenomenon is related with the anisotropic dielectric nature (\worktodo{ref to chapter
  5}).
%
We further show that such effect is concerted by the bandgaps of the
2D and bulk materials through both large-scale material database
screening.
%
More interestingly, repulsive vdW interactions are possible with careful dielectric engineering of the 2D material interface.
%
As a preliminary experimental demonstration, we show that the such
repulsive vdW forces can be indirectly probed using molecular epitaxy
on gold-supported graphene surfaced, as backed by the model presented
here.

\section{Modified Lifshitz-vdW Model For 2D Material Interfaces}
\label{sec:vdw-model-lifshitz}
%20191014-1529
We start the discussion in a system with simplified geometry: consider
two infinitely-large bulk materials (A and B) separated by a medium m
at distance \(d\), the total many-body interaction potential between A
and B over m, \(\Phi\), consists of the contributions from vdW
interactions \(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) and mono\-polar surface
interactions \(\Phi^{\pm}\)
\cite{van_Oss_1987_monopolar,Van_Oss_1988}, such that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-phi-oss}
\Phi = \Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} + \Phi^{\pm}
\end{equation}
where \(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) includes the Keesom (dipole -- dipole),
Debye (dipole -- induced dipole) and London dispersion (induced dipole
-- induced dipole) interactions~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book}, while
\(\Phi^{\pm}\) originates from interfacial monopoles (Coulomb
interactions) \cite{van_Oss_1987_monopolar}.
%
Note that $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ and $\Phi^{\pm}$ are all relative
energy scales compared with the infinitely-separated systems.
%
From the Lifshitz-vdW theory \cite{Dzyaloshinskii_1961_lifshitz},
\(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) stems from the fluctuations of electromagnetic
(EM) field, and can be regarded as the sum of oscillatory surface EM
mode energies, when the length scale of interest is larger than
atomistic details.
%
When the vdW contribution dominates (\ie chemically inert surface),
and retardation effect (due to limited speed of light, usually seen at
distance $>$20 nm~\cite{parsegian_van_2010_book}) can be ignored,
$\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ is total energy summed from all allowed EM modes
\cite{Li_2005_diele}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Phi-EM}
\Delta \Phi \approx \Delta \Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}
= \sum_{n} G(i \xi_{n})
= \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}{4 \pi^{2}}   
 \sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathcal{D}(i \xi_{n}, \mathbf{k}) 
\mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{k}
\end{equation}
where \(k_{\mathrm{B}}\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(T\) is temperature,
\(\xi_{n} = 2 \pi n k_{\mathrm{B}} T / \hbar\) is the n-th Matsubara
frequency, \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant, \(\mathbf{k}=(k_{x},
k_{y})\) is the transverse wavevector, and the prime over summation
denotes a prefactor of 1/2 when \(n=0\). \(\mathcal{D}\) is the dispersion
relation of the particular system and geometry that for any allowed
complex frequency \(\omega\) and wavevector \(\mathbf{k}\),
\(\mathcal{D}(\omega, \mathbf{k}) \equiv 0\). The dispersion relation
constructed by solving the Poisson-Laplace equation \(\nabla \cdot
[\varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \nabla
\psi(\mathbf{r})] = 0\), where \(\varepsilon_{0}\) is the vacuum
permittivity, \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}(\mathbf{r})\) and
\(\psi(\mathbf{r})\) are the dielectric function and electrostatic
potential at position \(\mathbf{r}\), respectively, and is highly
influenced by the dielectric anisotropy of media \cite{Lu_2016_torque}.
For materials have distinct in- and out-of-plane dielectric functions
(\(\varepsilon^{xx} = \varepsilon^{yy} = \varepsilon^{\parallel}\),
\(\varepsilon^{zz} = \varepsilon^{\perp}\)) , the total interaction
energy is expressed as (details see Supplementary Section
\ref{SI-sec:deriv-mdb}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Phi-aniso}
\Delta \Phi = \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{8 \pi d^{2}} 
\sideset{}{'} \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}(i \xi_{n})}
\int_{0}^{\infty} x \ln\left[1 - \Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}(i \xi_{n}) \Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}(i \xi_{n}) e^{-x}\right] \mathrm{d} x 
\end{equation}
where \(\Delta_{\mathrm{jm}} = (\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{j}} -
\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{m}}) / (\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{j}} +
\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{m}})\) represents the interfacial dielectric
mismatch between materials j (either A or B) and m, and
\(\hat{\varepsilon} = \sqrt{\varepsilon^{\parallel}
\varepsilon^{\perp}}\) is the geometric average of dielectric tensor. A
renormalization factor \(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2} =
\varepsilon^{\perp}_{\mathrm{m}} /
\varepsilon^{\parallel}_{\mathrm{m}}\) emerges as the consequence of
dielectric anisotropy of medium m. It is easy to observe, when
\(\varepsilon^{\perp}_{\mathrm{m}} \ll
\varepsilon^{\parallel}_{\mathrm{m}}\), \(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2} \ll 1\),
which greatly attenuates the total interaction \(\Delta \Phi\) compared
with isotropic medium (\(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2} \equiv 1\)).
