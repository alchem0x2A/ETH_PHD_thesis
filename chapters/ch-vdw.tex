\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:vdw-introduction}
% 20191014-1539
The van der Waals (vdW) interactions are inter\-atomic /
inter\-molecular forces that stem from the electromagnetic (EM)
fluctuations~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book,Woods_2016_rev_vdw,parsegian_van_2010_book}.
%
Unlike trivial electrostatic (Coulombic) forces that depends on the
charge stat, the vdW interaction has a complex electro\-dynamic
origin, and acts ubiquitously between all atoms and molecules,
regardless of their charge
state~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book,Hermann_2017_vdW_rev}.
%
As briefly discussed in \autoref{sec:inter-forc-at}, although being a
relatively weak force, the vdW interactions can be dominating at
molecule-2D interface due to the absence of dangling bonds.
%
The understanding and engineering of the vdW interactions at the 2D
material interface would greatly benefit molecular
self-assembly~\cite{Kumar_2017_rev_assemb_2D},
electronic~\cite{Wang_2015_phys_chem_tuning_TMDC,Lazar_2013} as well
as optical properties~\cite{Geim_2013_2D_vdw_Het,Novoselov_2016_vdW}
of 2D material-based hetero\-structures.
%
\worktodo{try to say more about the dielectric properties}

As introduced in \autoref{sec:van-der-waals}, one particular question
of interest is the transmission of vdW interactions through the
atomically-thin 2D materials.
%
The effective distance of vdW forces, depending on the medium, can
vary from sub-nm 10$^{1}$ nm~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book}, and are
relatively longer compared with the sub-nm thickness of 2D materials.
%
Therefore, the vdW forces from an macroscopic substrate may
(partially) penetrate through the 2D layer and be felt by an molecule
on the 2D material interface~\cite{shih_2013_wetting_natmat}.
%
This feature
brings potentially unprecedented surface properties by simply coating
an existing bulk surface with 2D
material(s)~\cite{Prasai_2012_coating,rafiee_2012_transparency,Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D}.
%
Based on classic pair-wise model~\cite{Hamaker_1937_vdW} of vdW
forces, the interaction free energy per area $\Phi_{\mathrm{vdW}}$,
between two semi-infinite bulk bodies (A and B) separated by distance
$d$, is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vdw-hamaker-res}
  \Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} = - \frac{A_{\mathrm{AB}}}{12 \pi d^{2}}
\end{equation}
where $A_{\mathrm{AB}}$ is known as the Hamaker constant of vdW
interactions between materials A and B.
%
A quantitative statement can be drawn from such simple model: by inserting a 2D material (\eg graphene
with thickness $\sim{}$3.3 \AA{}~\cite{Shearer_2016}) between two bulk
bodies (3$\sim{}$5 \AA{} \worktodo{cite 1 here}), 20--40\% of the vdW
interactions can still penetrate through the 2D layer.
%
Several unprecedented phenomena concerning the interfacial vdW forces
on 2D materials take credit from the analysis above, including wetting
transparency / translucency
\cite{Shih_2012_prl,rafiee_2012_transparency,Gurarslan_2016_screen_MoS2} and remote
epitaxy \cite{Kim_2017_remote_epi_Gr,Kong_2018_pol}.

Despite the seemingly accordance with experimental observations in
these studies, the prerequisites for the classical model are the
perfect additivity of vdW interactions, and a constant
$A_{\mathrm{AB}}$. 
%
In other words, the classic model assumes that the existence of the
2DEG has no influence on the EM waves that arise from charge
fluctuations.
%
Such picture is however challenged by recent experimental
\cite{Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D} and first-principles
\cite{Ambrosetti_2018_carbon,Liu_2018_gr,Li_2018_screen} studies,
revealing the 2D material-dependent Hamaker coefficient.
%
To correctly capture the many-body picture of vdW interactions at 2D
material interfaces, electro\-dynamic effects beyond the classic model
is needed.
%
In practice, this is usually a challenging task, since state-of-art
density functional theory (DFT) used for first principle simulations
is limited ground state electron density, intrinsically lacking charge
fluctuation~\cite{Woods_2016_rev_vdw}.
%
On the other hand, full-scale interaction energy calculations based on
dynamic non-local dielectric responses are usually time-consuming and
only limited to small
systems.~\cite{Hermann_2017_vdW_rev,Zhou_2017_lifshitz}
%
Therefore, novel theoretical frameworks with both appreciable accuracy
while maintaining simplicity, is of high demand to shed light on the
vdW interactions at 2D material interfaces.

In this chapter, we present
the a generalized model to study the many-body vdW transmission
through 2D materials, based on the modified Lifshitz-vdW theory
\cite{Dzyaloshinskii_1961_lifshitz,parsegian_van_2010_book}.
%
Based on the model, the vdW transmission through a 2D material is
selective, such that a 2D material acts as a high-pass filter of vdW
interaction, filtering the low-frequency interactions.
%
Such phenomenon is related with the anisotropic dielectric nature (\worktodo{ref to chapter
  5}).
%
We further show that such effect is concerted by the bandgap of both the
2D and bulk materials through both large-scale material database
screening.
%
More interestingly, repulsive vdW interactions are possible with careful dielectric engineering of the 2D material interface.
%
As a preliminary experimental demonstration, we show that the such
repulsive vdW forces can be indirectly probed using molecular epitaxy
on gold-supported graphene surfaced, as backed by the model presented
here.

\section{Modified Lifshitz-vdW Model For 2D Material Interfaces}
\label{sec:vdw-model-lifshitz}
% 20191014-1529

\subsection{Generalized Model For Layered Anisotropic Media}
\label{sec:vdw-gener-model-layer}

\worktodo{Add scheme here}
We start the discussion in a system with simplified geometry: consider
two infinitely-large bulk materials (A and B) separated by a medium m
at distance \(d\), the total many-body interaction potential between A
and B over m, \(\Phi\), consists of the contributions from vdW
interactions \(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) and mono\-polar surface
interactions \(\Phi^{\pm}\)
\cite{van_Oss_1987_monopolar,Van_Oss_1988}, such that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-phi-oss}
\Phi = \Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} + \Phi^{\pm}
\end{equation}
where \(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) includes the Keesom (dipole -- dipole),
Debye (dipole -- induced dipole) and London dispersion (induced dipole
-- induced dipole) interactions~\cite{Israelachvili_2011_book}, while
\(\Phi^{\pm}\) originates from interfacial monopoles (Coulomb
interactions) \cite{van_Oss_1987_monopolar}.
%
Note that $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ and $\Phi^{\pm}$ are all relative
energy scales compared with the infinitely-separated systems.
%
From the Lifshitz-vdW theory \cite{Dzyaloshinskii_1961_lifshitz},
\(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) stems from the fluctuations of electromagnetic
(EM) field, and can be regarded as the sum of oscillatory surface EM
mode energies, when the length scale of interest is larger than
atomistic details.
%
When the vdW contribution dominates (\ie chemically inert surface),
and retardation effect (due to limited speed of light, usually seen at
distance $>$20 nm~\cite{parsegian_van_2010_book}) can be ignored,
$\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ is total energy summed from all allowed EM modes
\cite{Li_2005_diele}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-EM-energy}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} = k_{\mathrm{B}} T \sum_{j} \ln \left[2 \sinh\left(\frac{\hbar \omega_{j}(\mathbf{k})}{2 k_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right)\right] 
\end{equation}
where \(\omega_{j}\) is EM frequencies of allowed mode $j$ that
corresponds to the (i) geometry and dielectric profile of the system
and (ii) the in-plane wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\).
%
The system-specific information of the EM modes can be generalized by
writing the dispersion relation ($\mathcal{D}$)of system, such that
\(\mathcal{D}(\omega_{j}(\mathbf{k})) \equiv
0\)~\cite{Guttinger_1966_dispersion,Mahanty_1976_dispersion_book}.
%
Analyzing the mode frequency \(\omega_{j}\) is usually a non-trivial
task, while on the other hand, using the Cauchy integral theorem, the
integral in \autoref{eq:vdw-EM-energy} is equivalent to the summation
over the imaginary Matsubara frequencies $\xi$
\cite{Mahanty_1976_dispersion_book} as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-lifshitz-general-2}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} = \frac{1}{2} k_{\mathrm{B}} T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{\mathbf{k}}\ln \mathcal{D}(i \xi_{n}, \mathbf{k})
= k_{\mathrm{B}} T \sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \ln \mathcal{D}(i \xi_{n}, \mathbf{k})
\end{equation}
where \(k_{\mathrm{B}}\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(T\) is
temperature, \(\xi_{n} = 2 \pi n k_{\mathrm{B}} T / \hbar\) is the n-th
Matsubara frequency and the prime in the summation refers to the
prefactor of 1/2 when \(n=0\). Here we assume the dispersion relation
\(\mathcal{D}\) has time-reverse symmetry, i.e.
\(\mathcal{D}(i\xi, \mathbf{k}) = \mathcal{D}(-i\xi, \mathbf{k})\).
%
The summation over \(\mathbf{k}\) can be further carried out in
continuous integral if the system is infinitely large
%
For the 3-layer system considered here (refer to AmB in the remaining
text) that is infinite in \textit{xy}-direction while non-periodic in
\textit{z}-direction, the summation over \(\mathbf{k}\) in
\autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-general-2} can be written using in-plane wave
vector \(\mathbf{k} = (k_{x}, k_{y})\):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-lifshitz-integral}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} = \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \sideset{}{'} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} \ln \mathcal{D}(i\xi_{n}, \mathbf{k}) \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{k}
\end{equation}
%
While along the \textit{z}-direction, the electrostatic potential
\(\psi\) follows the Poisson-Laplace equation, such that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-poisson-laplace}
\nabla \cdot [ \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}(\mathbf{r}, z) \cdot \nabla \psi]
= -\rho(\mathbf{r}, z) = 0
\end{equation}
where \(\mathbf{r}=(x, y)\) is the in-plane coordinates,
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}$ is the dielectric tensor of each material,
and \(\rho\) is the free charge density in the system, and for van der
Waals interactions alone, \(\rho \equiv 0\).
%
The periodicity of the \textit{xy}-plane leads to the form of
plane-wave form of $\psi$~\cite{parsegian_van_2010_book}\worktodo{if
  cite is correct?}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-deriv-pot-pw}
\psi(\mathbf{r}, z) =  
f(z) e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} 
\end{equation}
where \(f(z)\) is the variation in the \emph{z}-dierction.
%
Here we use a mean-field assumption that $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}$ is
uniform inside each material \worktodo{cite if this is proper}.
%
Due to the dielectric anisotropy discussed in \worktodo{ref to
  previous section}, we consider a general case, that in material $i$,
the dielectric tensor $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}$ consists of different
diagonal components \(\varepsilon^{xx}\), \(\varepsilon^{yy}\) and
\(\varepsilon^{zz}\). \autoref{eq:vdw-poisson-laplace} for individual
layer now writes:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-laplace-2}
\varepsilon_{i}^{zz} \frac{\partial^{2} f_{i}(z)}{\partial z^{2}}
- (k_{x}^{2} \varepsilon_{i}^{xx} + k_{y}^{2} \varepsilon_{i}^{yy}) f_{i}(z)
\end{equation}
which is further simplified to:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-laplace-3}
\frac{\partial^{2} f_{i}(z)}{\partial z^{2}}
- g_{i}^{2}(\vartheta) \kappa^{2} f_{i}(z) =0
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ and $\vartheta$ are the polar coordinates of
$\mathbf{k}$ such that
\(\mathbf{k} = (\kappa \cos\mathcal{\vartheta}, \kappa\sin
\mathcal{\vartheta})\), and
\(g_{i}^{2} = {\displaystyle
  [\frac{\varepsilon_{i}^{xx}}{\varepsilon_{i}^{zz}} \cos^{2}
  \vartheta + \frac{\varepsilon_{i}^{yy}}{\varepsilon_{i}^{zz}}
  \sin^{2} \vartheta]}\).
%
\(g_{i}^{2}\) characterizes the dielectric anisotropy of medium $i$
and upscales the wavevector modulus \(\kappa\). Note for an isotropic
medium, $g_{\mathrm{m}}\equiv1$. \worktodo{modify this
  sentence}\worktodo{need to unify the anisotropy with last chapter}

% 
Following the similar procedure of dispersion relations in isotropic
systems \cite{parsegian_van_2010_book}, the dispersion relation
\worktodo{add something in the brackets} of an AmB layered system with
dielectric anisotropy is written as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-disper-D}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{D}
&=
1 - 
\underbrace{\left[
\frac{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{A}} - \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} g_{m}(\vartheta) }{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{A}} + \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta)}
\right]}_{\Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}}
\underbrace{\left[
\frac{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{B}} - \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta) }{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{B}} + \varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta)}
\right]}_{\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}}
e^{-2 g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta) \kappa d} \\
&= 1 - \Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}(\vartheta) \Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}(\vartheta) e^{-2 g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vartheta) \kappa d}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where \(\hat{\varepsilon}_{i}\) is the geometric averaged dielectric
function of material $i$ ($i$=A, m or B), $\Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}$ and
$\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}$ are the dielectric mismatch between Am and Bm
interfaces, respectively.  Combining
with~\autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-integral}, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final}
\begin{aligned}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}
&= \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \mathrm{d}\vartheta
\int_{0}^{\infty} \kappa \mathrm{d}\kappa 
\ln[1 - \Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}(\vartheta) 
\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}(i\xi_{n},\vartheta) e^{-2 g_{\mathrm{m}}(i\xi_{n},\vartheta) \kappa d}] \\
&= \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{16 \pi^{2} d^{2}}
\sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} 
\frac{1}{g^{2}_{\mathrm{m}}(i\xi_{n},\vartheta)}\mathrm{d}\vartheta
\int_{0}^{\infty} x \mathrm{d}x
\ln[1 - \Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}(i\xi_{n},\vartheta) \Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}(i\xi_{n},\vartheta) e^{-x}] \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the last step is obtained using an auxiliary variable \(x = 2
g_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathcal{\theta}) \kappa d\).
%
\worktodo{add figure about convergence}
%
The integral in \autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final} is dominated by
the contributions from $x < 5$, and its convergence is almost
independent of $\Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}$ or $\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}$. In
other words, the contributions from high-\textbf{k} regime to the
total vdW interactions, is negligible.  \worktodo{think about this
  figure}

An important feature of \autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final} is that
the total energy $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ can be greatly attenuated
through a medium with high dielectric anisotropy (\ie
$g_{\mathrm{m}} \gg 1$).
%
Such high dielectric anisotropy between in- and out-of-plane
permittivities (giant birefringence) is only possible to achieve using
layered \cite{Collin_1958_aniso,Weber_2000_aniso} or low-dimensional
\cite{Niu_2018_aniso,Segura_2018_aniso} materials. Inspired by this,
by inserting a 2D material between bulk materials A and B, the
many-body \worktodo{hyphen or not?} vdW interactions may also be
screened by the high dielectric anisotropy, which contradicts with the classical theory of vdW interactions. \worktodo{another subfigure}
%
In the next section, we extend the modified Lifshitz-vdW model in
order to be applied to 2D material-containing systems.


\subsection{Applying Model to 2D Material Systems}
\label{sec:vdw-model-2D}
% 20191014-2027

The general model presented in \autoref{sec:vdw-model-2D} can be
extended to model the many body vdW transmission through 2D material
systems.
%
The exact solution to the many-body vdW interaction energy of such
mixed-dimensional system requires the knowledge of the full
spatially-varied permittivity profile \cite{Podgornik_2004_continuum},
which can be cumbersome to compute.
%
Instead, we use a mean-field treatment for
the dielectric response of the medium, Inspired by the concept in
\worktodo{ref to previous section}, if medium m consists of a layer of
2D sheet and surrounding vacuum, the average dielectric response
inside the medium m can be calculated using the effective medium
approach, using the 2D polarizability. \worktodo{ref to the equation}
%
Note here two assumptions are made: (i) the dielectric properties of
the 2D material is not influenced by the bulk material (\ie no
substrate doping and interfacial coupling) and (ii) the length scale
of the gap ($d$) is larger than the intrinsic thickness of the 2D
material, such that an uniform description of $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}$ is acceptable.
%
Since both criteria can be fulfilled at larger separation
distance~\cite{Dobson_2012_rev} (\eg $d>$1 nm), when the overlapping
between electron clouds of individual materials are negligible, we
limit our discussions in this regime throughout this chapter.
%
Moreover, As discussed above, the total vdW interaction energy is dominated by
the EM modes at $x \leq 5$, or equivalently
\(\kappa \leq 2.5 (g_{\mathrm{m}} d)^{-1}\).
%
When $d$ is at the order of 2 nm, and the typical anisotropy value for
a 2D material $g_{\mathrm{m}}=2.5$, we see that the majority of interaction comes
from EM modes with \(\kappa<0.0625\) \AA{}\textsuperscript{-1}\worktodo{verify the numbers}, close to the optical limit ($k\to0$).
%
Within this regime, $\alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}$ of the 2D material as well
as $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{B}}$ of bulk
materials can be regarded as
constant~\cite{Li_2005_diele}.
%
In other words, the calculation of $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ only requires
dielectric data at the optical limit, which greatly simplifies the
computational expense.\worktodo{refine sentence, fine 1 more citation}

A large variety of 2D materials (\eg materials with P6/mmm,
P$\overline{6}$m2, P$\overline{3}$m1, \worktodo{cite more symmetries}
symmetries) has isotropic in-plane electronic polarizabilities (\ie
$\alpha^{xx}_{\mathrm{2D}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}^{yy} = \alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}^{\parallel}$) due to
symmetric electronic structure. For an AmB system constructed by these
materials, we have
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{xx} =
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{,}}^{yy}=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}$,
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{zz} = \varepsilon_{\mathrm{2D}}^{\perp}$ ,
and $g_{\mathrm{m}}$ independent of $\vartheta$. As a result,
\autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final} can be simplified to:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}[t]
\label{eq:vdw-Phi-aniso-main}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} &= \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{8 \pi d^{2}} 
\sideset{}{'} \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}(i \xi_{n})}
\int_{0}^{\infty} x \ln\left[1 - \hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Am}}(i \xi_{n}) \hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Bm}}(i \xi_{n}) e^{-x}\right] \mathrm{d} x \\
\hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{jm}}(i\xi) &= \frac{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{j}}(i\xi_{n}) -
\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{m}}(i\xi_{n})}{\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{j}}(i\xi_{n}) +
\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{m}}(i\xi_{n})},\ \mathrm{j=A, B}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\(\hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{jm}}\) represents the
$\vartheta$-independent interfacial dielectric mismatch between
materials $j$ (either A or B) and m.
%
Alternatively, \autoref{eq:vdw-Phi-aniso-main} can also be expressed
using single-frequency interaction energy $G(i\xi_{n})$ as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}[t]
\label{eq:vdw-Phi-single-point}
\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}} &= \sideset{}{'} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} G(i \xi_{n}) \\
G(i \xi_{n}) &= \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{8 \pi d^{2}} \frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}(i \xi_{n})}
\int_{0}^{\infty} x \ln\left[1 - \hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Am}}(i \xi_{n}) \hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Bm}}(i \xi_{n}) e^{-x}\right] \mathrm{d} x
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 
\autoref{eq:vdw-Phi-single-point} is the main equation for the calculation
of $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ in this chapter. As can be seen, it is
correlated with only a few frequency-dependent dielectric properties
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{A}}$, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{B}}$ and
$\alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}$ \worktodo{optic or optical?}, as well as distance $d$.


The dielectric function of bulk materials are obtained from both
experimental spectroscopy data~\cite{Palik_1998_handbook} and first
principles simulations.
%
On the other hand, the electronic polarizability of 2D
materials are solely from first principles simulations due to the
problem with experimentally measured optical properties of 2D
materials as mention in \worktodo{ref to previous section}.
%
Note in the framework of Lifshitz-vdW model, the dielectric responses
are sampled on the imaginary frequencies ($i\xi$), while the data
obtained from optical measurements and first principles calculations
are usually on real frequencies ($\omega$). The real and imaginary
frequencies can be unified by the complex frequency
$\omega_{\mathrm{C}} = \omega + i\xi$~\cite{parsegian_van_2010_book}
\worktodo{a better cite than this?}.
%
The conversion between $\varepsilon$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}$ from
real frequencies to imaginary frequencies are performed using the
Kramers-Kronig relation (KKR)~\cite{Roessler_1965_KKR}, such that:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:vdw-KKR-eps}
  \varepsilon(i\xi) &= 1 + {\displaystyle \frac{2}{\pi}}{\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\infty}} {\displaystyle \frac{\omega \mathrm{Im}(\varepsilon(\omega))}{\omega^{2} + \xi^{2}}} \mathrm{d}\omega \\
  \label{eq:vdw-KKR-alpha}
  \alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}(i\xi) &= {\displaystyle \frac{2}{\pi}} {\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\infty}} {\displaystyle \frac{\omega \mathrm{Im}(\alpha_{\mathrm{2D}}(\omega))}{\omega^{2} + \xi^{2}}} \mathrm{d}\omega
\end{eqnarray}
%
More details about the data acquisition, first principles simulations
and the computation details of the modified Lifshitz model, are
discussed in \autoref{sec:vdw-methods}.  \worktodo{show example of KKR

\subsection{High-Pass vdW Transmission Through 2D Materials}
\label{sec:vdw-high-pass-vdw}

% \subsection{Effect of Dielectric Anisotropy in 2D Material-Containing Medium}
% \label{sec:vdw-effect-diel-anis}

Compared with $\varepsilon(\omega)$ that has a complex value and
multiple transition peaks \worktodo{better choice of words?},
$\varepsilon(i \xi)$ after the KKR are monotonically decaying,
real-value functions, which greatly simplifies the analysis in the Lifshitz-vdW model.
%
As an example, the in- and out-of-plane dielectric functions
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}(i \xi)$ and
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\perp}(i \xi)$ for \worktodo{79} type of 2D
materials in the 2D material-containing medium m at $d=2$ nm, are
shown in \worktodo{figure}, respectively.
%
For illustration purpose, the data are shown on continuous frequency
domain instead of discrete Matsubara frequencies. Moreover, the curves
of graphene, 2H-MoS\textsubscript{2}, and hBN are
highlighted. \worktodo{better wording}
%
We observe that for a typical 2D medium,
\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}\) greatly exceeds
\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\perp}\) at low frequency range ($\xi <$
10 eV), while the difference diminishes at high frequency regime, when
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}$ and
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\perp}$ approach unity.
%
To characterize the decaying behavior, we introduced the in- and
out-of-plane transition frequencies \(\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\parallel}\)
and \(\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\perp}\), defined as the frequency that
\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{p}(i \xi^{p}_{\mathrm{tr}}) - 1 =
\frac{1}{2}[\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{p}(i\xi=0) - 1]\), where
$p=\parallel$ or $\perp$.
%

The values of $\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\parallel}$ and
$\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\parallel}$ differ greatly between in- and
out-of-plane directions.
%
Firstly, \(\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\parallel}\) is generally smaller than
\(\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\perp}\), which is related with the quantum
confinement perpendicular to the 2D
plane~\cite{Matthes_2016_effective_PRB}.
%
Moreover, we found that $\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\parallel}$ almost
linearly scales with the bandgap of the 2D material
$E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}$, while $\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\perp}$ is
almost independent of $E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}$. \worktodo{figure insets}
%
Since the frequency-dependent $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\perp}$ varies
much less than $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}$, the behavior of
\(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}\) is dominated by
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}$, as shown in
\worktodo{figure}.
%
Considering the fact that $1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}$ modulates the
magnitudes of $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ at each frequency (see
\autoref{eq:vdw-lifshitz-aniso-final}), its behavior is analogous to a
high-pass band filter~\worktodo{cite 1} \worktodo{think of using G for frequency
  part?}
%
In other words, the vdW interactions are selectively screened at low
frequencies, which arises from the dielectric anisotropy of 2D
materials.
%
More interestingly, the minimum value of $1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}$ always
occurs at $\xi = 0$ due to its monotonic shape.
%
From the analysis in \worktodo{ref to dielectric section},
$1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}(\xi=0)=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\perp} /
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}^{\parallel}$ is dominated by
$E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}$.
% Combine with the fact that
% $\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}^{\parallel}$
\worktodo{mention more about the $\xi_{\mathrm{tr}}$?}
%
As a result, the penetration of vdW interactions is expected to be
more screened by a 2D material with smaller bandgap, which is in good
agreement with recent full-scale \textit{ab initio}
studies~\cite{Liu_2018_gr}.
%
The mechanism behind such high-pass vdW transmission phenomena, is
schematically shown in \worktodo{figure c}.

The model proposed here is capable to explain the
strong vdW force screening by 2D materials observed in AFM experiments
\cite{Tsoi_2014}.
%
To simulate the experimental conditions, we model the
many-body vdW interaction between SiO\textsubscript{2} (A) and Si\textsubscript{3}N\textsubscript{4} (B), by
varying the 2D materials (m).
% according to Equation \ref{eq:Phi-aniso}.
\worktodo{figure here} shows \(\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) as a function of
\(d\) when varying the 2D material.
%
Clearly, the presence of a 2D material (colored curves) universally
reduces the vdW interaction energy compared with a non-screened system
(\(\Phi^{0}\), gray curve) that the medium m is vacuum.
%
As expected, the reduction of $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ is stronger for 2D
materials with smaller \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}\).
%
Analogous to the results presented in
\cite{Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D}, the effective Hamaker constants
\(A_{\mathrm{eff}}\) are extracted from fitting of the curve using
\autoref{eq:vdw-hamaker-res}. 
%
Specifically, the effective Hamaker constant in the non-screened system is labeled as $A_{\mathrm{eff}}^{0}$.
%
\worktodo{Figure ??}b shows the normalized Hamaker constant
$A_{\mathrm{eff}} / A_{\mathrm{eff}}^{0}$ for various 2D materials at
$d=$ 5 nm, which almost linearly increases
with \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}\).
%
This
observation quantitatively agrees with the experimental ranking of
\(A_{\mathrm{eff}}\) in \cite{Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D}, that graphene (Gr) $<$ 2H-MoS\textsubscript{2} $<$ fluoro\-graphene (F-Gr).
%
More interestingly, the single frequency interaction energies
\(G(i\xi)\), exhibit distinct patterns between 2D materials. As shown
in \worktodo{figure which}, comparing with the non-screened case
($G^{0}$), even at \(d\) = 5 nm, semi\-metallic low-gap 2D materials
can still selectively screens low frequencies interactions with
\(\hbar\xi\) \textless{} 1 eV, corresponding to the Debye and Keesom
interactions \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2011}.
%
On the other hand, a wide-gap material like hBN shows much weaker high-pass filtering of vdW interactions.
%

% More insight into the non-linear
% behavior can be drawn from Equation \ref{eq:Phi-aniso}, with two
% factors leading to the material dependency of \(\Delta \Phi\): (i) the
% renormalization factor \(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}\) and (ii) the
% dielectric mismatch \(\Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}\) and
% \(\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}\). By decreasing
% \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}\), \(\Delta_{\mathrm{Am}}\) and
% \(\Delta_{\mathrm{Bm}}\) are monotonically suppressed over the whole
% frequency range (Supplementary Figure XX), while the screening of
% \(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}\) becomes more prominent at lower frequencies
% (Figure \ref{fig1}c).
To unify the understanding of the 2D material-mediated screening of
vdW interactions, we borrow the concept of the field effect
transparency \worktodo{unify the notation} discussed in
\worktodo{chapter 1 section?}, to define the vdW ``transparency''.
%
We introduce two variables to quantify such transparency:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textbf{frequency-dependent vdW transparency} index $\tau(i\xi)$,
  defined as the ratio between the single-frequency vdW energy with
  and without the 2D material:
  \begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:vdw-def-tau}
  \tau(i \xi_{n}) = \frac{G(i \xi_{n})}{G^{0}(i\xi_{n})}
\end{equation*}

\item The \textbf{overall vdW transparency} index $\eta$, defined as
  the ratio between total vdW energy with and without the 2D material:
  \begin{equation*}
\label{eq:vdw-def-total-trans}
\eta = \frac{\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}}{\Phi^{0}}
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
\worktodo{should we use $G^{vdW, 0}$?}
%
\worktodo{figure which c} shows the values of $\tau(i \xi_{n})$
corresponding to \worktodo{which figure}, which clearly illustrates the
high-pass feature dominated by the dielectric anisotropy of 2D materials.

\subsubsection{Bandgap Dependecy of vdW Transparency}
\label{sec:bandg-depend-vdw}

From \autoref{eq:vdw-Phi-aniso-main}, unlike the factor
\(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}\) that solely depends on the dielectric
anisotropy of 2D material, \(\hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Am}}\) and
\(\hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Bm}}\) are jointly controlled by the
dielectric properties of both ulk and 2D materials, providing more
dimensions to modulate the many-body vdW transmission.
%
Benefited from
the fast numerical approach in our model, we are able to perform
large-scale evaluation of $\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ on a database with
78 two-dimensional materials and 138 bulk materials, generating a total number of
7.5\texttimes{}10\textsuperscript{5} combinations of AmB systems
(details see \autoref{sec:vdw-methods}).
%
\worktodo{Figure 3?} shows the 3D scatter plot of
\(\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) at \(d\) = 2 nm, with the magnitudes of
$\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ indicated by a color mapping. Inspired by the
fact that dielectric properties of both bulk \cite{Moss_1950} and 2D
materials \worktodo{ref to previous} are highly related to their
electronic band structure, we use the bandgaps of bulk materials
(\(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{A}}\), \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{B}}\)) and
2D material (\(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}\)) as the axes in
\worktodo{Figure 3?} \worktodo{better words?}.
%
As expected, increasing
\(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{2D}}\) makes the 2D material more
transparent to vdW interactions (red).
%
Conversely, an increase of \(\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) can also achieved
by lowering both \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{A}}\) and
\(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{B}}\) simultaneously.
%
Clearly, the results in \worktodo{figure 3?} shows an systematic
approach to tune the vdW transparency by changing the bulk/2D material
combinations.


To get more insights into the complex dependency of
\(\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) on the combination of materials, we first take
horizontal slices of the 3D scatter plot \worktodo{which figure}, to
study the effect of varying the bulk materials while fixing the 2D
material.
%
As an example, the cases corresponding to graphene,
2H-MoS\textsubscript{2} and hBN are shown in \worktodo{another figure,
  a-c}, respectively.
%
Two trends can be observed: (i) hBN shows higher $\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}$
(more transparent) compared with graphene and 2H-MoS\textsubscript{2}
regardless of the bulk material, which is ascribed to its large
bandgap. (ii) $\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ is generally higher around the
region that \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{A}} \to 0\) and
\(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{B}} \to 0\) (lower diagonal edge) compared
with \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{A}} \gg E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{B}}\)
or \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{B}} \gg E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{A}}\)
(off-diagonal edges) in the 2D scatter plots.
%
It is intriguing to see such defined patterns even
if the choice of bulk materials spans over wide range of lattice types
and electronic structures.

Here we show it is possible to describe such bandgap dependency of
$\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ using a relatively simple approach, based on the
single Lorentz oscillator model (SLOM).
%
The idea of SLOM is to describe the monotonically decaying dielectric
function on imaginary frequency with few parameters. We describe the
dielectric function $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Bulk}}$ of a bulk material
based the Drude-Lorentz model of single oscillator\worktodo{cite
  Lorentz} and the Kramers-Krönig relations \worktodo{ref to previous
  chapter}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vdw-lorentz-imag}
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Bulk}}(i \xi) 
=
1 + \frac{\xi_{\mathrm{p}}^{2}}{\xi_{\mathrm{g}}^{2} + \Gamma \xi + \xi^{2}}
\end{equation}
 where 
\(\xi_{\mathrm{g}}\) is the intrinsic oscillation frequency,
\(\xi_{\mathrm{p}}\) is the plasma frequency related to the valence
electron density, and \(\Gamma\) is the damping parameter.
The parameters \(\xi_{\mathrm{g}}\) and \(\xi_{\mathrm{p}}\) can
be extracted using the following relations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Bulk}}(i \xi_{\mathrm{g}}) = \frac{1}{2} (\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Bulk, 0}} - 1)\)
\item \(\xi_{\mathrm{p}}^{2} = (\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Bulk, 0}} - 1) \xi_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}\)
\end{enumerate}
where
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Bulk, 0}} = \varepsilon_{\mathrm{Bulk}}(i\xi =
0)$ is the static electronic permittivity.
%
Interestingly, the bulk materials studied show a general linear trend
between \(\hbar \xi_{\mathrm{g}}\) and the bandgap
\(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{Bulk}}\), as shown in \worktodo{which
  figure?}  On the other hand \(\hbar \xi_{\mathrm{p}}\) is almost
independent of \(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{Bulk}}\) and scatters between
10\(\sim\)20 eV.  For simplicity, we propose the following relations
for \(\xi_{\mathrm{p}}\) and \(\xi_{\mathrm{g}}\):
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\hbar \xi_{\mathrm{g}}\) = 1.04\(E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{Bulk}}\) + 2.25 eV
\item \(\hbar \xi_{\mathrm{p}}\) = 12.7 eV (averaged value of \(\hbar
   \xi_{\mathrm{p}}\))
 \end{enumerate}
 In addition, we choose a relative small $\Gamma$ such that
 $\hbar \Gamma$ = 0.05 eV~\worktodo{cite?}.  The simplicity of SLOM
 allows constructing $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Bulk}}(i \xi)$ profiles
 with arbitrary bandgap, and can be used to explore the vdW
 transparency beyond the existing material combinations.
 

\worktodo{Which figure}d-f show the 2D
contour plots of $\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ for graphene,
2H-MoS\textsubscript{2} and hBN calculated using SLOM corresponding
to \worktodo{which figure}a-c, respectively.
%
To our surprise, the features observed in the scatter plots from
material database can be nicely captured using such simplified
model.
%
Further more, the SLOM resolves even more details: along the diagonal
direction (\ie symmetric system, A=B), a minimum in
$\eta^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ can be seen for graphene and
2H-MoS\textsubscript{2}.
%
The existence of the minima in the vdW transparency of symmetric
systems is an evidence that the vdW transmission through a 2D material
is the competition between the electronic fluctuations in the bulk
material and the dielectric screening through the 2D material.  To see
this effect, we notice \autoref{eq:vdw-Phi-single-point} in this case can be simplified to:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vdw-sym-simply}
  G(i \xi) \propto \int_{0}^{\infty} x \ln \left[ 1 - \hat{\Delta}^{2} e^{-x}\right] \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation}
where
$\hat{\Delta}^{2} =
\hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Am}}\hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{Bm}}$ when A=B.
%
\worktodo{New figure}a indicates the integral in
\autoref{eq:vdw-sym-simply} can be approximated by $\hat{\Delta}^{2}$
when ...\worktodo{make decision after plot}. We further consider the
possible values of \(\Delta^{2}\), given the single frequency
dielectric functions \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}(i \xi)\) and
\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{A}}(i \xi)\), as shown in \worktodo{Figure}b.
When the 2D material is fixed, by varying
\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{m}}\), the value of \(\hat{\Delta}^{2}\)
approaches 0 when
\(\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{A}} = \hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{A}}
\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{m}}\). Ideally, if such condition is
fulfilled at any frequency \(i\xi\), the 2D material is completely
opaque to vdW interactions. However this is hard to achieve for real
materials, as the frequency-dependent dielectric functions between
bulk and 2D materials can hardly coincide throughout the frequency
domain. 


We note our theory of bandgap dominance of vdW transparency, does not
violate the recently discovery that 2D materials are more
``transparent'' to remote epitaxy of materials with higher polarity
\cite{Kong_2018_pol}. In such situation where the driving force is
formation of chemical bonding from interfacial danging bonds, the
interaction potential from monopolar surface \(\Phi^{\pm}\) (see \autoref{eq:vdw-phi-oss}), is dominating over the vdW
interactions. Although the Coulomb interactions can also be
effectively screened by 2D material
\cite{Li_2014_screen,Ambrosetti_2019_jpcl}, its strength still
overwhelms the vdW interactions. We also comment that the single
oscillator picture may be oversimplified for many other materials
beyond this study~\worktodo{cite 1}, more precise techniques of the
dielectric properties such as multiple Lorentz oscillator model are
required.

\subsection{Distance Dependency of Many-body vdW Interactions}
\label{sec:vdw-distance}

The last component to control the vdW transmission through 2D
materials, is the distance $d$.  From \worktodo{equations to
  alpha-eps}, \(\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{m}}\) decreases with the
distance \(d\) roughly by a power law of \(d^{-1}\). When
\(d \to \infty\), we have \(\hat{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{m}} \to 1\) and
\(1/g_{\mathrm{m}}^{2} \to 1\) on the whole frequency range. In this
case, the many-body vdW interaction recovers its form when the medium
is vacuum ($\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}, 0}$).
%
In addition to the trivial picture that $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$
decreases with $d$, the
high-pass transmission feature is also affected.
%
To see this effect, we plot the frequency-dependent interaction energy
\(G(i \xi)\) at different distances for various symmetric bulk-2D
\worktodo{bulk-2D or 2D-bulk?}  materials combinations, as shown in
\worktodo{figure X?}.
%
If m is vacuum, the maximum value of $G(i \xi)$ is always at
$\xi \to 0$, and increasing $\delta$ only trivially down\-scales the
magnitudes of $G(i \xi)$. However if m contains a 2D materials, a
clear change in the shape of \(G(i \xi)\) can be observed upon
increasing $d$,
%
For graphene (\worktodo{figure}a1-a3), a peak exists in the profile of
\(G(i \xi)\) corresponding to the selective screening of vdW
interactions with $\hbar \xi<$5 eV due to the high-pass transmission
discussed in \worktodo{section?}.
%
The peak position drifts to lower energy range with increasing $d$.
%
On the contrary, if the 2D material is 2H-MoS\textsubscript{2} or
h-BN, the high-pass peak only exists with a wide-gap bulk material
like cubic BN (\worktodo{figure}xx-xx). Similar red-shift of the peak
position with increasing \(d\) is also observed in these systems,
indicating the screening effect of the 2D material becomes closer to
vacuum (peak position = 0 eV).


Another exotic behavior concerning the distance-dependency of vdW
interactions through 2D materials, is the power law with $d$
\worktodo{try better wording, and cite Gobre paper}.
%
When the medium m is vacuum, \(|\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}|\) always exhibits a
power law of \(d^{-2}\), as can be expected from
\autoref{eq:vdw-hamaker-res}.
%
In other words, the log-log plot for \(\Delta^{\mathrm{vdW}}\) vs
\(d\) in an unscreened system shows a straight line with slope of -2
\worktodo{as shown in figure?}.
%
However, based on our analysis above, the existence of 2D material
causes stronger screening of $\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ at shorter
distance, and the log-log profile \(|\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}|\) vs \(d\)
deviate from that in the non-screened case.
%
Apparently, the vdW interaction in such system cannot be simply
described by the $d^{-2}$ Hamaker-vdW model. Here we define the
derivative $\partial \log(|\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}|)/ \partial d$ as the
``local'' power exponent $p_{\mathrm{local}}$, such that
$\Phi^{\mathrm{vdW}}$ approximately decays at a rate of
$d^{-p_{\mathrm{local}}}$ at certain value of $d$.
%
To demonstrate, we choose A=SiO\textsubscript{2} and
B=Si\textsubscript{3}N\textsubscript{4} as demonstrated in
\worktodo{figure xx} to mimic the AFM measurements in
\textcite{Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D}.
%
As shown in \worktodo{another figure}, the vdW interactions through a 2D material have $p_{\mathrm{local}} < 2$ due to the screening.
\(p_{\mathrm{local}}\) asymptotically approaches the vacuum limit of 2 when $d \to \infty$.
%
In the case of graphene and 2H-MoS\textsubscript{2},
\(p_{\mathrm{local}}\) can be as small as $\sim{}$0.5 at \(d\) = 2 nm.
There are several implications from such abnormal power law due to the
existence of 2D material. Firstly, the effective Hamaker constant
approach that frequently used to interpreter experimental
results~\cite{Tsoi_2014_vdW_screening_2D}\worktodo{cite 1+} should be
taken with great caution. Moreover, the small power exponent of
many-body vdW interactions makes them even longer range forces than
non-screened vdW interactions. This may lead to some extraordinary
physical phenomena as we show in the next section.
